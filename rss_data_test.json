This gave Matt some time to dig around on his own and discover his own path while he waited for his official introduction to the way of LeadingAgile. During this interview, we discuss some of the most valuable things Matt picked up on during his first few weeks and his take on what it is like getting started at LeadingAgile. In a few weeks, once he has officially completed his onboarding, were going to do a follow-up to see how he felt about his official introduction to LeadingAgile.</p>\n<p>For anyone considering working here, or getting started working here, this interview should offer valuable tips on what makes LeadingAgile a unique place to work and how to make the most of your initial days with the company.</p>'}], 'subtitle': 'This week LeadingAgile Senior Consultant Matthew Oatts joins Dave for a different kind of interview.

If you are planning for the results you want to achieve, and you and employ a strategy where we can continue inspecting and adapting towards that desired result, regardless of how many things you can check the done box on along the way, then you are outcome-focused.</p>\nContacting Greg DePasquale:\n<p>Web: <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/greg-depasquale/">https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/greg-depasquale/</a><br />\nLinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregdepasquale/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregdepasquale/</a><br />\nEmail: <a href="mailto:greg.depasquale@leadingagile.com">greg.depasquale@leadingagile.com</a></p>\nContacting Dave Prior\n<p>If you’d like to contact Dave you can reach him at:</p>\n<ul><li>LeadingAgile: <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/dave-prior/">https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/dave-prior/</a></li>\n<li>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsungo">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsungo</a></li>\n<li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mrsungo">https://twitter.com/mrsungo</a></li>\n<li>Email: <a href="mailto:dave.prior@leadingagile.com">dave.prior@leadingagile.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a question you’d like to submit for an upcoming podcast, please send them to <a href="mailto:dave.prior@leadingagile.com">dave.prior@leadingagile.com</a></p>\n<p>And if you\'re interested in taking one of our upcoming Certified ScrumMaster or Certified Scrum Product Owner classes, you can find all the details at <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/our-gear/training/">https://www.leadingagile.com/our-gear/training/</a></p>'}], 'subtitle': "In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Managing Consultant, Greg DePasquale explains what Outcome-Based Planning is, how it works, why it's so critical for enabling successful delivery, and how it works at different levels of the organization.\nI...", 'subtitle_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/feed.xml', 'value': "In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Managing Consultant, Greg DePasquale explains what Outcome-Based Planning is, how it works, why it's so critical for enabling successful delivery, and how it works at different levels of the organization.\nI..."}, 'authors': [{'name': 'Dave Prior, Agile Consultant & Certified Scrum Trainer'}], 'author': 'Dave Prior, Agile Consultant & Certified Scrum Trainer', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Dave Prior, Agile Consultant & Certified Scrum Trainer'}, 'itunes_explicit': None, 'itunes_block': 0, 'itunes_duration': '21:32', 'itunes_episode': '362', 'itunes_episodetype': 'full'}, {'title': 'Managing Product Risk and Uncertainty with Design w/ Scott Sehlhorst and Will Evans', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'Managing Product Risk and Uncertainty with Design w/ Scott Sehlhorst and Will Evans'}, 'itunes_title': 'Managing Product Risk and Uncertainty with Design w/ Scott Sehlhorst and Will Evans', 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/e/managing-product-risk-and-uncertainty-with-design-w-scott-sehlhorst-and-will-evans/'}, {'length': '59858695', 'type': 'audio/mpeg', 'href': 'https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/nndwb9/Managing_Product_Risk_and_Uncertainty_with_Design.mp3', 'rel': 'enclosure'}], 'link': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/e/managing-product-risk-and-uncertainty-with-design-w-scott-sehlhorst-and-will-evans/', 'comments': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/e/managing-product-risk-and-uncertainty-with-design-w-scott-sehlhorst-and-will-evans/#comments', 'published': 'Thu, 30 Apr 2020 09:16:53 -0500', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=4, tm_mday=30, tm_hour=14, tm_min=16, tm_sec=53, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=121, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'leadingagile.podbean.com/09a9e623-e3da-5a19-bfa7-61aaad0ced12', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': "When we are trying to figure out what products to build, we have to develop a deep understanding of the problem we are solving.

Recently, Julianne spent a week serving as the ScrumMaster for the volunteers that helped put on the 2019 North American Global Scrum Gathering.\nIn this episode of SoundNotes, Julianne shares some details about her experience volunteering for the Scrum Alliance. She talks about the work she did in Austin acting as a servant leader for the many people who gave their time in order to make the North American Global Scrum Gathering one of the most valuable Agile events to take place each year. During the interview, Dave and Julianne discuss why volunteering for professional organizations is so important, the benefits you receive as a reward for your time, and what it’s like to spend a few days coming together with dedicated people who want to commit their time to ensure that the people who come to the Scrum Gathering have the best possible experience.\nNote from Dave:\nVolunteering for professional organizations like the Scrum Alliance and the Agile Alliance is one of the most powerful things you can do to develop your career.

And if you're looking for a detailed explanation of how to go about figuring all this out, this conversation may provide you with the blueprint you need to get started making sure you actually know who it is you're trying to “delight” with the products you create.\nThe graphic below is referenced throughout the podcast, you’ll want to have that handy as you listen.\n\nLinks From The Podcast\nThe podcast Scott and Dave previously recorded which includes a detailed walk through of how to create an empathy map can be found here:Creating Empathy Maps with Scott Sehlhorst\nYou can find Dave Gray's Empathy Map template here: http://gamestorming.com/empathy-mapping/\nContacting Scott Sehlhorst\nIf you’d like to contact Scott you can reach him at:\nLeadingAgile: https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/scott-sehlhorst/\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sehlhorst\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sehlhorst/\nBlog: http://tynerblain.com/blog/\nContacting Dave Prior\nIf you’d like to contact Dave you can reach him at:\nLeadingAgile: https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/dave-prior/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsungo\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mrsungo\nEmail: dave.prior@leadingagile.com\nIf you have a question you’d like to submit for an upcoming podcast, please send them to dave.prior@leadingagile.com\nAnd if you're interested in taking one of our upcoming Certified ScrumMaster or Certified Scrum Product Owner classes, you can find all the details at https://www.leadingagile.com/our-gear/training/"}, 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/feed.xml', 'value': '<p>When we develop products, we\'re responsible for maximizing the value we deliver to the customer.

This journey from your current state, into a state that\'s capable of fully leveraging the System of Delivery, may actually require a System of Transformation.</p>\n<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, our CEO & Founder, Mike Cottmeyer spends some time with Dave digging into what a System of Transformation is, why this is different than a System of Delivery, how the two are connected, and why having a System of Transformation is such a critical part of your organization\'s ability to realize the benefits of taking an Agile approach to delivering work.</p>\nContacting Mike Cottmeyer\n<p>If you’d like to contact Mike you can reach him at:</p>\n<ul><li>LeadingAgile:\xa0<a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/mike-cottmeyer/">https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/mike-cottmeyer/</a></li>\n<li>LinkedIn:\xa0<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cottmeyer/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/cottmeyer/</a></li>\n<li>Twitter:\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/mcottmeyer">https://twitter.com/mcottmeyer</a></li>\n<li>Email: <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/dave-prior/">https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/dave-prior/</a></li>\n<li>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsungo">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsungo</a></li>\n<li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mrsungo">https://twitter.com/mrsungo</a></li>\n<li>Email: <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/our-gear/training/">https://www.leadingagile.com/our-gear/training/</a></p>'}], 'subtitle': 'When people talk about Agile, they often talk about the approach they are taking: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, SAFe, LeSS, DAD, Nexus, etc. These and the other frameworks and methodologies that could be considered to fall under the Agile umbre...', 'subtitle_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'When people talk about Agile, they often talk about the approach they are taking: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, SAFe, LeSS, DAD, Nexus, etc. These and the other frameworks and methodologies that could be considered to fall under the Agile umbre...'}, 'authors': [{'name': 'Dave Prior, Agile Consultant & Certified Scrum Trainer'}], 'author': 'Dave Prior, Agile Consultant & Certified Scrum Trainer', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Dave Prior, Agile Consultant & Certified Scrum Trainer'}, 'itunes_explicit': None, 'itunes_block': 0, 'itunes_duration': '45:58', 'itunes_episode': '292', 'itunes_episodetype': 'full'}, {'title': 'What is the Worth of a Good Product Owner? w/ Tim Wise', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'What is the Worth of a Good Product Owner? w/ Tim Wise'}, 'itunes_title': 'What is the Worth of a Good Product Owner? w/ Tim Wise', 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/e/what-is-the-worth-of-a-good-product-owner-w-tim-wise/'}, {'length': '27508655', 'type': 'audio/mpeg', 'href': 'https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/584six/Tim_Wise_March_2019.mp3', 'rel': 'enclosure'}], 'link': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/e/what-is-the-worth-of-a-good-product-owner-w-tim-wise/', 'comments': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/e/what-is-the-worth-of-a-good-product-owner-w-tim-wise/#comments', 'published': 'Thu, 21 Mar 2019 06:32:26 -0500', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=3, tm_mday=21, tm_hour=11, tm_min=32, tm_sec=26, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=80, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'leadingagile.podbean.com/what-is-the-worth-of-a-good-product-owner-w-tim-wise-0c7250bf8a0645f0fc44bebbe2ef6a4c', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': "This week, on SoundNotes, we're featuring another question from a student in one of our Certified Scrum classes.

The podcast offers some tips in general about Agile estimation, things to watch out for, how to estimate work using Story Points and Poker Planning, how to estimate work using T-shirt sizing, and–once you break your Product Backlog Items down into discrete tasks—how to estimate the using Ideal Hours. There are volumes that can be said about how to estimate work and a lot of fun "debates" to be had along the way, but if you\'re struggling to understand it, if you need to get a sense of whether your current approach makes sense, or if you just want a refresher on how to go about it, this podcast should give you plenty to start working with.</p>\nFor More on Agile Estimation\n<p>LeadingAgile\'s FieldNotes has a number of posts covering different aspects of how to estimate work in Agile.

Imagine what it would be like if NASA didn’t have all those stations that had to report in with “Go for launch” or “No Go for launch”. Imagine how that would work if we assumed we all had the same understanding of what "Ready for Launch" actually meant?\nIn this episode of SoundNotes, Dave Prior is giving a tutorial on how to create a Definition of Done for your team. If you\'re following Scrum as it\'s defined, then “done” and potentially shippable are intended to be the same thing. Unfortunately, for many organizations, this isn\'t something that holds true. For example, your team may require additional integration testing that is done by a separate team and happens outside the Sprint. Yes, it’s dysfunctional from a Scrum perspective. Yes, you should try to fix it, but sometimes you’ve got what you’ve got and you\'re too fully consumed with other battles.\nOver the course of the podcast, Dave talks about having clarity on three different levels of done. Here\'s what the\xa0three levels look like:\nWork that is “done” and can be presented to the Product Owner for Acceptance - this is an agreement between the PO and the Dev Team.\nExample:\nCode Complete\nTest Cases are automated and executed\nNo defects\nAcceptance Criteria Met\nPass Unit Testing\nPass Code Review\nDocumentation Complete as defined in Acceptance Criteria\nTeam knows how they will present feature during Sprint Review\n\xa0\n2.

Scrum Alliance’s Certified Scrum Professional (CSP) designation is changing on Jan 1, 2018.

Many of them have come back with questions about how to earn the SEUs required for the CSP designation.\nIn this podcast, Scrum Alliance Director of Global Learning and Assessment, Erika Massie and Scrum Alliance Learning Coordinator, Cody Wanberg break down the changes to the CSP certification, the timeline for the change AND we talk through different ways to attain the required SEU’s before the deadline.\nIt’s a short podcast, so no actual show notes for this one. Just a few things to keep in mind…\nIn order to qualify for CSP before the change, you must have your completed application submitted to the Scrum Alliance before it becomes 2018 in Denver.\nOnce you submit, the turnaround time you should expect is 8 weeks.\nHere are a few of the ways you can earn SEUs…\nWatch the CST facilitated webinars on the Scrum Alliance website. There are 19 of these and they are an hour each. If you watch them all, you’ll earn 19 SEUs.\nWatch the Scrum Foundations e-learning series to earn 1 SEU.\nIf you took a CSM or CSPO, each class is worth 16 SEUs. If you’ve taken both, that is 32. AND, if you’ve taken CSM or CSPO more than once, you get the 16 for each time you take the class.\nDuring the interview, Cody and Erika explain that listening to something like the Agile Uprising’s Manifesto Author Review podcast series could be submitted under Category E - Independent Learning. You get 1 SEU for each hour of time spent listening. It is a great series and I highly recommend it. You can find it here.\nThere are a number of additional ways to earn SEUs and you can find that detailed on the Scrum Alliance site. https://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/practitioners/csp-certification/ways-to-earn-seus\nAdditional Questions\nIf you have questions for the Scrum Alliance about the changes to CSP or SEU’s, send an email to support@scrumalliance.org with the subject line CSP Application Question', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'The Scrum Alliance’s Certified Scrum Professional (CSP) designation is changing on Jan 1, 2018.

This time about architecture and if the complexity of it would be better served by a waterfall approach:\n\nThe Question:\n\n"How to plan for the Architecture effectively. With waterfall, we try to figure out all aspects of the business and the technical solution in advance before we start development. In Agile, we discover as we go. It\'s very likely that when we come to a certain, we\'ll find either the current business logic or the current technical framework cannot adapt our upcoming demands.

For some, it is like a lightbulb went off and everything about Agile just makes sense. For others (like me), some of the ideas and values from waterfall persist for a time. Questioning agile and trying to reconcile this new way of thinking with the old way is part of the personal journey of moving from a traditional approach to an agile way of working. I tend to think of it as a hangover that occurred from drinking a little too much waterfall. In this week\'s podcast, I address 3 questions that were submitted by a student following a recent class. These were the same kinds of questions I was asking when I took my CSM training and was getting my head around agile. In the podcast I address not only the questions that were asked, but the bigger ones that may be more subtext - around, why do we need to work this way? The questions: 1. What are the factors that lead us to the decision to go Agile or Waterfall? The simple "Scrum is best suited for complex projects" (page 10 of the workbook) doesn\'t seem to be enough and there could be challenges against that statement. The more complex the issue is, the more effort we would want to spend upfront instead of down the road. Is earlier we detect the issues the less cost to fix it? 2. We know a perfect scrum team should be cross functional but in reality, we\'re far from that. The question is how to fix the velocity gap between the roles to maximize their efficiency? E.g. developers code faster than testers (usually when the system is huge and a single change would require a lot of regression testing). We know we can fix it by adjusting the ratio among the roles but the amount of work changes overtime, if we keep adjusting the ratio we will NOT have a stable scrum team. 3. As User Stories do NOT contain the requirement details, the requirement is actually conveyed through discussion between PO vs Dev team, how can we capture the product specification? The Product Specification is extremely important for many purposes including training of new team member, doing impact analysis, or for PO to know how the current system works so they can plan for future improvement. Should we spend effort to compose/update Product Specs? If we do, will that be a User Story or just count it as overhead ?

In my world the confusion here is most often related to design inputs. Any digital product will have a visual UI and thus its development will require design inputs. Do most of Leading Agile clients consider this a separate process that contributes to the readiness of stories for a technical Scrum team? Or do you normally assume designers are a part of a Scrum team?\n\nIn my view, the former creates waterfall-like dependencies and the latter gets in the way of confident estimations. So, even if both models are feasible, none of them seems ideal, because it leaves an are that has to be tightly managed.”\n\n8:20 Question 2 - How do you deal with a manager who thinks you should be ScrumMaster for multiple teams AND Product Owner at the same time?\n\nThis question was submitted by a student in a CSPO class who allowed me to record the question being asked as long as I promised not to post the recording or identify the person by name. In order to honor that, I played the recording for Derek before hand, but in the podcast, what you’ll hear is me (Dave) relating the question. \n\nThe question shared by the student related to the fact that they are currently playing the role of ScrumMaster on three  different teams and have also been asked to act as Product Owner for these teams. The person explained to their manager that the way Scrum is designed to work, a ScrumMaster is supposed to be dedicated to a single team, should definitely not be trying to support three teams and absolutely should not be playing the role of ScrumMaster and Product Owner at the same time. The manager responded by asking that the person give a detailed account what they are doing all day as a Scrum Master because the manager did not believe the person was too busy to be able to serve as ScrumMaster for three teams and Product Owner for as those teams as well. \n\n9:32 Derek and Dave respond and respond to the question.\n\n19:25 Podcast wrap up\n\n20:12 Podcast end\n\nContacting Derek \nYou can reach Derek on the LeadingAgile site at https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/derek-huether/\nOn Twitter at https://twitter.com/derekhuether\nOr on his personal site at http://www.derekhuether.com\n\nContacting Dave\nYou can reach Dave on the LeadingAgile site at https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/dave-prior/\nOn Twitter at https://twitter.com/mrsungo\nOr on his personal site at: http://drunkenpm.net\n\nFeedback/Questions\nIf you have comments on the podcast, or have questions for the LeadingAgile coaches that you’d like to have addressed in a future episode of LeadingAgile’s SoundNotes, you can reach Dave at dave.prior@leadingagile.com\n\nLeadingAgile CSM and CSPO Classes\nFor information on LeadingAgile’s upcoming public CSM and CSPO classes, please go to: www.leadingagile.com/our-gear/training/\nUse the discount code: LA_Podcast to receive a 15% discount on the class.', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://soundnotes.leadingagile.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'This episode of SoundNotes features two questions that were submitted recently by students. \n\n2:11 Question 1 - Design and Cross Functional Teams\nSubmitted by Sergey via Email : \n“Every time I hear you speak about cross-functional team I am not sure who these teams comprise of exactly.
