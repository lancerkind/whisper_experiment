                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the face of change, many people inside large organizations are often left with more questions than answers. Do I have the ability to lead my team through this? Do I possess the necessary skills? Will my role become obsolete? Is my job safe? A good change management strategy accounts for these questions and tries to reduce the angst surrounding the change by deploying solid stakeholder management practices.</p>
<p>Today, Mike and Dave sit down to discuss how we approach stakeholder management and reveal some of the tactics we deploy during a transformation to create safe, win-win situations for all those participating in the change effort.</p>

<p>Today, Mike and Dave sit down to discuss how we approach stakeholder management and reveal some of the tactics we deploy during a transformation to create safe, win-win situations for all those participating in the change effort.</p>

And often, it’s due to one or two team members who aren’t quite carrying their fair share of the weight.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Business Agility is all about creating strategic alignment between different parts of your organization. One of the ways that we help our clients create strategic alignment is by implementing a four-tiered governance model that has a dedicated strategy team, or investment team on top. This team is responsible for setting the strategy, applying context for all the other teams, and making sure that they are holding the system of delivery accountable.</p>
<p>But this requires a shift in how you think about things like metrics, OKRs and KPIs. IT requires a shift in how you think about funding and what it means to have a system of delivery. We explore all this and more in this episode of SoundNotes.</p>

<p>In this podcast, Mike and Dave sit down to discuss how your personality type influences the way you see and value culture, and the implications that can have on your business. Together they explore different types of personalities, how they manifest in the Agile community, and some ways the Agile community can find some common ground to achieve what we’re all chasing—greater Business Agility.</p>

<p>Why are so many Agile coaches and ScrumMasters getting laid off? Is it because Agile is disappearing? Or is it because they’ve gotten so dogmatic about the rules and ceremonies surrounding Agile that they’re more of a burden then they are valuable? In our latest episode of SoundNotes, Mike Cottmeyer and Dave Prior explore the how to balance the competing priorities of the Agilists and the leaders they’re trying to help so that everyone can get back succeeding with Agile.</p>

Mike asserts that dependencies kill Agility and that they’re meant to be broken.

<p>The debate quickly rolls into a conversation about dealing with legacy technical debt and business capability modeling and how we need to focus on minimizing dependencies in all aspects of the business, not just at the team level.

<p>When organizations set out to adopt Agile, they always have a business reason. It’s never just because they really love Scrum, or SAFe, or LeSS. But when the teams start doing all the Agile things, and they’re met with resistance from the organization around them, it’s hard to point to success because not much changed. So, we start defining success as “do the roles and ceremonies exist and are we following all the Agile dogma.” That’s a poor definition of success, and we have to get better at changing the organization around the teams. But that’s a different problem altogether. To do that, we’ll have to deconstruct what people, especially leaders inside organizations, believe about Agile and get them to see it through an all-new lens.</p>
<p>Mike and Dave sit down to begin deconstructing some of the current beliefs about Agile, and talk about what success actually looks like in this week’s episode of SoundNotes.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Agile practices don’t automatically lead to Business Agility. In the presence of dependencies and organizational impediments that the teams have no ability to change, going through the motions of Scrum or SAFe isn’t going to lead to greater Business Agility either. So, you can train the teams all you want, but if it doesn’t lead to greater Agility, who cares?</p>
<p>Listen as Mike Cottmeyer and Dave Prior discuss some common misconceptions about Agile Transformation, how training often leaves businesses wanting more, and some things to consider if you’re thinking about starting an Agile Journey of your own. Also, stick around for the end, where Mike reveals who his favorite fictional Project Manager is.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Len Greski joins Dave to discuss leadership and emotional systems. Len is a Principal Consultant at LeadingAgile and he has a background in sociology. As Len explains, “The most difficult challenge in delivering great products is getting people to work together." During the interview, we explore emotional systems theory and how that can be applied within our organizations and teams to create sustainable change and deliver great products.</p>
<p>The Bowen Family Systems Theory was developed by Dr. Murray Bowen. It is rooted in taking a systems view in studying families and the relationship patterns that develop between family members. Bowen’s theory and the eight concepts that came out of it can also be applied to the workplace and the emotional systems we create and participate in day to day. The better you are able to understand these systems, the more able you will be to foster systems that lead to a positive outcome for your team, your organization, and your customer.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s podcast was created as a response to a question we were recently asked by some of our CSM/CSPO course students. This one is for all the team members and Scrum Masters, the people on the ground who see why Agile could make a huge difference in their entire organization but just don’t have the title or agency to sign the contracts to make it happen.</p>
<p>What they wanted to know is: How does someone who isn’t at contract-signing level create a conversation where they can get the leaders above them to be open to Agile Transformation? </p>
<p>Dave and Mike will unpack the answer, including discussion on how to hone in on what executives care about and value, and some important questions to ask yourself about the organization and its goals before you start the conversation. They’ll share tips on how to craft the right kind of conversation to get leaders to understand why Agile Transformation is worth doing.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Senior Consultant, Matthew Oatts joins me to talk about what to do when you are placed in a leadership role, but not given a lot of clarity on what you are specifically supposed to do or how you are supposed to do it. How do you lead people when you don’t have clear boundaries or you don’t have clarity on what your leadership is looking for.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, this guidance is lacking because the people you report to don’t actually know and are just waiting for you to figure it out. How can you be successful in your role when success is not clearly defined for you?</p>
<p>If you’ve ever found yourself in that situation, Matthew Oatts and I talk through different ways to respond when you find yourself in this situation.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Agile Transformation is more than just installing Agile processes or Agile principles. It’s more than simply training your team on Agile methodology. But if that’s the case, then what is the actual path to becoming an Agile organization? </p>
<p>You must create the conditions where Agile processes can be deployed and exploited for better outcomes than you had before—so you can get more value, better ROI, more predictability, and more. But to create this foundation, you need a way to move the organization incrementally and iteratively through Transformation that operates with certain characteristics. LeadingAgile has found a way to do this with what we call a Systems-first approach to Agile Transformation. </p>
<p>In this podcast, LeadingAgile CEO Mike Cottmeyer and host Dave Prior candidly explore and discuss the details of the LeadingAgile Systems-first approach, including how it started, why it has become a proven and tested way to successfully enable any organization to Transform, and how each part of the system works.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode of SoundNotes, Dave is joined by LeadingAgile Chief Marketing Officer Tim Zack. Tim offers his unique perspective on how to communicate within an organization during an Agile Transformation to influence lasting change. The biggest part of an Agile Transformation is asking people to work differently at a job they might have been doing for years. People are naturally resistant to change, especially when their livelihood is on the line.
Tim discusses the strategies that organizations can use to communicate where they want to go. It's about influencing people over a period of time, not going in and trying to change the culture first. This is why we lead with a systems first approach because they adapt to change faster than people. Making lasting change in an organization is a slow, repetitive process as people become ready to hear it, understand it and apply it.]]></itunes:summary>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week LeadingAgile Senior Consultant Matthew Oatts joins Dave for a different kind of interview. This is the first of two interviews we will be posting with Matthew and they both focus on what it is like to work here at LeadingAgile and how to make the most of your early days with the company. Because LeadingAgile has a unique point of view and approach to organizational change and Agile transformation when people join the company we take extra care to make sure they are up to speed on the LeadingAgile Why and How. As the company has matured over the years our on-boarding process has gone through a number of iterations and has evolved into a very comprehensive robust program.</p>
<p>But, Matt joined LeadingAgile during the 2nd half of December of 2021. In consulting, the last few weeks of December are pretty slow and this meant Matt was going to need to wait for an on-boarding class to start. This gave Matt some time to dig around on his own and discover his own path while he waited for his official introduction to the way of LeadingAgile. During this interview, we discuss some of the most valuable things Matt picked up on during his first few weeks and his take on what it is like getting started at LeadingAgile. In a few weeks, once he has officially completed his onboarding, were going to do a follow-up to see how he felt about his official introduction to LeadingAgile.</p>
<p>For anyone considering working here, or getting started working here, this interview should offer valuable tips on what makes LeadingAgile a unique place to work and how to make the most of your initial days with the company.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the fourth episode in our series of podcasts about Fixed vs. Growth Mindset. Using the book Mindset by Carol Dweck as a jumping-off point, Mary Kaufmann and Dave Prior dig into the topic of criticism.
The conversation focuses on the way Fixed vs. Growth Mindset people approach giving and receiving criticism. Along the way, Mary and Dave both share examples of how they've struggled in the past with giving and receiving feedback. They also share things they've each learned while trying to take a more growth-minded approach to criticism.]]></itunes:summary>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This podcast is our third in a series of conversations focused on Fixed vs. Growth Mindset. Leveraging the work in Carol Dweck’s book, Mindset, Mary Kaufman and Dave Prior explore the differences between having a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. Each episode of this series focuses on how our mindset impacts the way we perceive and respond to different types of stimulus/events.</p>
<p>This episode is focused on effort and the differences between how a fixed mindset and a growth mindset perceive the value we receive from applying ourselves at work. Do we see the effort spent as a waste of time, or a step towards achieving some level of mastery that can be a reward all by itself?</p>

They are also expected to develop a level of skill with having the ability to take on different coaching stances when they are working with individuals, teams, and organizations. In LeadingAgile’s Certified Scrum Master classes we devote time to exploring servant leadership and four of the coaching stances a Scrum Master needs to be able to take: Teaching, Facilitating, Coaching, and Mentoring. In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile’s Learning and Development Coordinator, Luther Harris joins Dave to share his take on what being a servant leader entails and how these four stances must be developed in succession because they build on one another. Luther has a background in education that plays heavily into his take on these topics.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes is an interview with LeadingAgile CEO, Mike Cottmeyer who takes on 3 separate topics during the interview:</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">1. Locus of Blame (01:38)</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">2. Elevate Agile (27:38)</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">3. Speaking with Authority  (41:39)</p>
<p>Locus of Blame</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">Things happen. They don’t always happen the way we want them to. You get a flat tire on the way to a job interview, your supplier is late resulting in a massive delay in your delivery of a project, there’s a pandemic and that messes up pretty much everything you had planned. The questions you ask yourself in response to these kinds of setbacks are very important. Learning how to learn from these challenges may not come naturally to you but it is a critical skill.</p>
<p>Elevate Agile  </p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">This September, LeadingAgile will be holding an event to celebrate its 11 year anniversary (because Covid got in the way of the 10 year anniversary), and we’re also holding our 2nd Elevate Agile conference. During the interview Mike shares some details about this very exciting event.</p>
<p>Speaking with Authority</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">While advancing in their career many people get to a stage where it is important for them to be able to enter a room, take over, and lead. For some, this comes with ease, but for many, it is the opposite. They can’t see how to get from being the person who was never asked (or allowed) to lead, to being someone who can "own" a room of people. Mike shares details about how (and when) he worked through that. And similar challenges he has worked through since. If you are someone who does not feel you have the agency/experience/authority/power to take the room, you’ll find some helpful tips in this part of the interview.</p>

While advancing in their career many people get to a stage where it is important for them to be able to enter a room, take over, and lead. For some, this comes with ease, but for many, it is the opposite. They can’t see how to get from being the person who was never asked (or allowed) to lead, to being someone who can "own" a room of people. Mike shares details about how (and when) he worked through that. And similar challenges he has worked through since. If you are someone who does not feel you have the agency/experience/authority/power to take the room, you’ll find some helpful tips in this part of the interview.

Many of us have returned, or soon will be returning, to the office. After a year working from home, that shift back to the thing that was once part of our every day work lives, is going to present unique challenges for each of us. Some have been champing at the bit, waiting to get back to a busy social IRL work atmosphere. Others discovered that working from home actually provided greater productivity and comfort. No matter how you reacted to the pandemic lock-down, returning to the office is gonna be a little weird.</p>
<p>In this episode of the podcast, LeadingAgile Executive Coach/Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Kelly Lingerfeldt joins Dave to talk about returning to the office, the challenges that will present for each of us, and different strategies we can use to cope with getting out from behind the Zoom camera, swapping our sweat pants for actual pants and going into the office.</p>

<p>LeadingAgile believes strongly in giving back. And whenever we can we provide open seats in our classes to those whose work is to serve others. We offered Uttam a seat and agreed to check back a few months after class to see how he’d been able to put what he learned to use. During the interview, Uttam and Dave talk about how he has introduced some of the key principles and values from Agile back to his teams and the people they serve. You’ll also hear about how they’ve begun using Scrum to run marketing experiments in their ministry work.</p>

<p>But what if that isn’t an option? What if you work in an organization that still believes in the power of multi-tasking, or you work in an agency whose whole business model is built around the idea that everyone is 100% utilized across however many teams/projects are needed to hit that number?</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Jeff Howey and Dave Prior take on the question of what to do if you don’t have dedicated teams. They explore the various forms this commonly takes, how it is likely to impact your ability to deliver value and they share some coping mechanisms as well as ideas on how to approach the conversation with the appropriate people when the time comes.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s SoundNotes features a question submitted by a student during a recent Certified Scrum Master class. The question was posted in the topic parking lot and we did not have time to address it during class, so I followed up with the student after class and we discussed it via phone. I also offered to do a podcast on it and Jeff Howey joins me this week to dig into the topic. Because I spoke to the student after class, I was able to add some more detail for Jeff which you will hear during the conversation, but the question posted by the student was:</p>

<p>I would like to know how long should milestones typically be and how many sprints should we break it down to? We have a goal of what we want to achieve and a rough timeline but we don’t log too many feature tickets ahead of time thinking that the task might become stale or pollute the board with an everlasting list of things to do and most of the time we were just closing the tickets. As a result, I feel we become short-sighted and optimize for the current sprint but not for the milestone.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode of SoundNotes, Ross Beurmann is back to talk about how to create a funding mechanism that's as adaptable as the governance model. Or, to put it more simply, how to allocate funds and pay for things when we're continually tuning the way we work, and what we're working on.</p>
<p>As your organization moves further down the path toward Agility, you may experience some dissonance when more traditional methods of funding work meet with the need to inspect and adapt. And we're not just talking about inspecting and adapting through the lens of product development,  we're also talking about how the organizational governance can inspect and adapt and how that supports Business Agility.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week in LeadingAgile’s SoundNotes, Justin Polk is here to discuss the role that capitalization plays in helping an organization adopt an Agile approach to work. When the conversation turns to Agile Transformation, it often focuses on what changes you need to introduce, where, and when. But sometimes we get so caught up in those conversations that we neglect to include one very important aspect… the money and how it is tracked. In this episode of the podcast, you’ll learn what CapEx (Capital Expenditure) is, why it matters, and why it is a fundamental concern in Agile Transformation.</p>

This episode of SoundNotes is a follow up to that whitepaper.

<p>During the interview, Jeff also explains PSTIR, which stands for Prepare, Socialize, Tailor, Implement, and Reinforce; and how PSTIR has become a critical part of the LeadingAgile approach.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week is all about Earned Value and Justin Polk is back, spending time with Dave discussing how Earned Value tools can be applied in an Agile Transformation. They explore what types of work you might want to consider using it for, how it can help, and what types of people might find the path to Agile just a little more possible when you show them how Earned Value metrics can be applied on an Agile Team.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Once you reach the point where you're ready to pursue a job in Agile, the next hurdle you'll often face is, “How?” Convincing someone to give you a job as a ScrumMaster or a Product Owner can be tough if you have no experience. And even if you do have experience, that doesn’t necessarily make it easier. The Pandemic has put a lot of people back into the applicant pool, and the competition is fierce.</p>
<p>In this week’s SoundNotes, LeadingAgile’s Director of Talent Acquisition Priya Sethuraman spends time with Dave talking about what to do if you are looking for a job in Agile. Priya and Dave discuss different approaches you can take, ways to prepare yourself to succeed in the interview, and how to begin working on getting experience and building your network even if you are completely new to the space.</p>

<p>In this episode, you’ll learn about some of the risks and challenges that come with pilots, why LeadingAgile takes a more holistic approach to piloting by selecting an entire vertical slice of the organization to work with, and how to begin having conversations about selecting the right part of your organization to serve as a pilot in your company’s Agile Transformation.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Getting a few teams up and running using Scrum, Kanban, or some other form of Agile is great. But that doesn’t necessarily mean your organization has become Agile.</p>
<p>This week in SoundNotes, Dragos Dumitriu joins Dave for a conversation about the difference between spinning up a few teams and truly achieving business Agility. During the conversation Dragos shares details on some of the common patterns, he sees when organizations begin moving towards an Agile approach, things to watch out for, and some of the conversations you need to be having internally if business agility is something your organization has set its sights on.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Managing Consultant, Greg DePasquale explains what Outcome-Based Planning is, how it works, why it's so critical for enabling successful delivery, and how it works at different levels of the organization.</p>
<p>In outcome-based planning, we focus on “a results-driven plan rather than plan-driven results." There is a focus on the Why as opposed to the How. We center around the business outcome we are looking to achieve, rather than making sure we are doing “all the things." If you work in a project-based organization and status is tracked by things done (or percent of a thing done), you are probably more output focused. If you are planning for the results you want to achieve, and you and employ a strategy where we can continue inspecting and adapting towards that desired result, regardless of how many things you can check the done box on along the way, then you are outcome-focused.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>When we are trying to figure out what products to build, we have to develop a deep understanding of the problem we are solving. To do that, we have to understand who we are solving problems for, what is important to them, and what offering would be most appealing to them or most likely to cause a change in behavior. Looking at the problem from different perspectives can enable it to be solved more easily, with each vantage point offering different insights that can complement each other. When we can discover things that are true across the board, we can be even more confident that we're headed in the right direction</p>
<p>LeadingAgile SVP, Executive Consultant, Scott Sehlhorst approaches this work from an engineering perspective. LeadingAgile Managing Consultant, Will Evans approaches the work from a Design perspective. While each vantage point is important, the true value comes from combining them.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Scott and Will join Dave to offer insight into how they each approach the work of understanding the user, the problems they are facing and the best way to solve them. This conversation digs deep into the product space and how we design solutions that truly meet the needs of our customers.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Ross Beurmann joins Dave to talk about the difference between Leadership and Management. Although many confuse the two and believe they are the same, they are actually very different things—and this can become extremely apparent during the transition to an Agile approach.</p>
<p>During the interview, Ross explains why it is so important that we gain clarity on the difference between the two, why we want to manage systems, and why it is so important that we inspire teams to manage themselves.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes Will Evans is back to discuss why behavior trumps empathy and the secret to building the right thing.</p>
<p>During the interview, we explore the difference between traditional Personas and Behavioral Impact Personas. We also talk through how Impact Mapping can be used to move beyond Empathy Maps to deepen our understanding of what motivates people, what their needs are, what things to build, how well they have to perform to be considered valuable, and how to make sure we are solving the right problems for the right people at the right time.</p>
<p>In this podcast, you will learn how Impact Mapping can draw a clear connection between the things we are going to build, the problems we need to overcome, and how to create a change in behavior by specific people that allows us to move toward an outcome that achieves our desired goal.</p>
<p>Will has created a few graphics that we refer to in the interview and you’ll want to download them in order to get the most out of this podcast. You can find links to them below.</p>

<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Principal Consultant, Marty Bradley spends time with Dave discussing why we need to connect strategy to execution and what happens when we don't. During the interview, Marty provides examples which demonstrate why we need to break the work down into small increments of value, how to track their performance at both the strategic and tactical level, how frequently you want to be checking in on whether or not the work is delivering the desired value,, and who needs to be involved in these discussions.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[One of the most critical, and unfortunately, neglected elements of ensuring your teams can deliver the most value possible, is making sure they can see a direct connection between the work they are being asked to execute on and that strategy that work is in service of.
In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Principal Consultant, Marty Bradley spends time with Dave discussing why we need to connect strategy to execution and what happens when we don't. During the interview, Marty provides examples which demonstrate why we need to break the work down into small increments of value, how to track their performance at both the strategic and tactical level, how frequently you want to be checking in on whether or not the work is delivering the desired value,, and who needs to be involved in these discussions.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week in LeadingAgile’s SoundNotes, Tina Wang spends some time with Dave talking about Lean Portfolio Management. During the conversation, Tina and Dave cover exactly what Lean Portfolio Management is and how it differs from a more traditional approach to Portfolio Management. A good part of the discussion is spent on the topic of how to create alignment from strategic goals at the organizational level down to delivery team execution and the role that funding plays in this.</p>
<p>If you have questions about Lean Portfolio Management or you're curious about how to apply Lean practices and systems thinking to traditional portfolio management to consistently deliver value at a sustainable pace, this podcast is a great place to get started.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Despite the fact that in many organizations the Enterprise Architect and the Enterprise Solutions Architect are often conflated, they are very distinct roles that require different skill sets and areas of expertise.</p>
<p>The Enterprise Solutions Architect is a role that focuses on designing solutions to problems that tend to be IT-centric, while an Enterprise Architect focuses more on designing or documenting the relationship between all the systems across the Enterprise and how they interact to deliver value.</p>
<p>In this episode of LeadingAgile's SoundNotes, Ross Beurmann is back to bring some clarity to the difference between the two roles, the nature of the work, and the differences in the skill sets required for each role.</p>
<p>Zachman Framework</p>
<p>During the interview, Ross references the Zachman Framework, which was developed by John Zachman in the 1980's. The framework "provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise" (see Wikipedia link below). If you'd like to read up on it, here are some places to get started:</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Managing Consultant, Matt Smith, joins Dave for a conversation about why we need to make sure that the investment made in portfolio tiers of the organization ties directly back to Agile delivery, and how we can make sure that is happening. If you are an executive who has responsibility for making decisions about where and how the organization makes strategic investments across the portfolio, this interview may expose some areas of focus that you may want to give more attention.</p>
<p>Many organizations introduce Agile, and begin funding Transformation, at the team level, but they fail to ensure that they’ve created an environment and organizational system that can support those teams, and/or teams who are working on things without understanding why because they don’t have visibility into how they link back to company strategy. This makes it difficult for them to make the best possible choices when developing a product. Throughout the podcast, Matt and Dave talk through examples of how detrimental this disconnect between the head and the body of an organization can be.</p>
<p>Making sure there is a direct line from investment to execution is critical to ensuring you are maximizing the value your organization (and your clients) are getting from your agile delivery mechanism.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week in SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Founder and CEO Mike Cottmeyer joins Dave to explore the ways in which Executive Leadership plays the role of Product Owner in an organization. During the conversation, Mike reflects back on how his understanding of what it means to be an organizational product owner has evolved as LeadingAgile has grown over the last ten years. Mike shares some of the ways he copes with the challenges of being the Product Owner of an organization that continues to evolve, how he responds to the successes and failures along the way, and his take on one of the most critical things a leader must do in order to be ready for what comes next.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!</p>
<p>In this episode, LeadingAgile Senior Consultant, Ross Buermann shares an approach that involves bifurcating the work of creating the documentation so that we can create and deliver in smaller increments. Those smaller pieces can be modified and maintained in a more efficient manner than they would be in a traditional approach. In the same way that we want to break development work down into small increments, we can also break down the documentation. Ross and Dave also discuss an approach to storing the documentation which allows for an easier approach to change control and maintenance.</p>
<p>Ross has a background in highly regulated environments where the documentation is often treated as being more valuable than the product itself. During the interview, Ross explains how, and why, this approach is so valuable to teams and organizations adopting an Agile approach.</p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!</p>
<p>In this episode, LeadingAgile Senior Consultant, Ross Buermann shares an approach that involves bifurcating the work of creating the documentation so that we can create and deliver in smaller increments. Those smaller pieces can be modified and maintained in a more efficient manner than they would be in a traditional approach. In the same way that we want to break development work down into small increments, we can also break down the documentation. Ross and Dave also discuss an approach to storing the documentation which allows for an easier approach to change control and maintenance.</p>
<p>Ross has a background in highly regulated environments where the documentation is often treated as being more valuable than the product itself. During the interview, Ross explains how, and why, this approach is so valuable to teams and organizations adopting an Agile approach.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Safety is a popular topic in the Agile space that comes up when we have conversations about what it takes to create an environment where Agile can take root and thrive.</p>
<p>When we talk about transforming organizations, we talk about things like creating a safe environment where people feel that they have the agency and support to run experiments in order to get better at working together and delivering value for the customer. This conversation often centers around teams and the individual team members, but rarely do we take the time to consider what safety looks like for leadership. Aren’t they at risk as well?</p>
<p>There may be leaders in your organization who are supporting or sponsoring the transformation effort, but what if it doesn’t take? What impact will it have on them? When it comes to organizational change, we know leadership has to adjust their approach as well, but this conversation often focuses on how the things they learned to do under a traditional model will get in the way of a successful Agile Transformation. We tell them what not to do: we tell them to leave the teams alone to figure out how to self-organize, we tell them to be supportive and let go of many of the practices that helped them reach their leadership position. It may come across as though we are simply taking things away from them, and this language of loss is unlikely to leave them feeling like they are operating from a place where they have the agency they need and the support they need to begin running experiments that will help them learn to grow into the Agile leaders we want and need them to be.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Senior Consultant, Tim Wise, and Dave Prior explore:</p>
<ul><li>What it means to create safety for leadership</li>
<li>What Agile Transformation asks of leaders and the risks they face</li>
<li>How leaders can begin moving toward an approach that demonstrates adopting an Agile mindset</li>
<li>What types of behavior are needed to foster a safe environment for the teams and team members to employ Agile practice to deliver value for their customers</li>
</ul>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>When large enterprises make the decision to invest in Agile Transformation they often do so with the expectation that it will have some positive impact on their ability to deliver. In theory, if we can deliver more of the right things in shorter time frames at a higher quality level, that should provide some kind of quantifiable return on investment.</p>
<p>When the conversation turns to the question of “How is the transformation going?” it is common to focus on metrics that center around how many teams or groups within the organization have begun adopting Agile practices, where they are in the journey towards Agile, how individual teams are performing, etc. But what is often harder to understand is what is the benefit, or return on the investment it is making in Agile Transformation.</p>
<p>To put it simply, we’re spending money, we’re doing the things… but what kind of financial (or other) impact is that money having on the organization and on our system of delivery?</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Principal Consultant, Doug Spencer joins Dave for a conversation about some of the ways you can begin to measure and quantify the impact of an Agile Transformation on your organization at the portfolio level.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>At ElevateAgile, LeadingAgile Principal Consultant, Marty Bradley, led a session called "The Business Value of Agility." The talk focused on the question of how organizations measure and understand the business benefits of adopting an Agile approach. All too often, organizations make a decision to "go agile" without defining the outcome they hope/want/expect from changing their approach to work. Without a solid understanding of the impact you are seeking, deciding whether your approach to creating things, or the things themselves, are delivering desired business value.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Marty and Dave explore some of the key takeaways from Marty's session at ElevateAgile and ways an organization can understand the value Agile provides.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Agile Transformation, every organization struggles with managing risks and dealing with dependencies. Identifying the most critical dependencies and finding a way to break them can be challenging. But, depending on your organization’s goals for transformation, there may also be dependencies that just aren’t worth decoupling. </p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes LeadingAgile Senior Consultant, Tom Furland, talks with Dave about how to handle Risks and Dependencies during Agile Transformation. We explore how to understand where decoupling is possible and why orchestration is so critical to creating flow within the organization, regardless of which dependencies remain.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Feedback is tricky.</p>
<p>We all want it, we all need it, but sometimes getting it can be kinda tough. Giving feedback is challenging as well because it can be hard to tell when were are offering it from a place that is truly centered on helping the recipient grow, rather than just helping them be what we want them to be.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Staff Consultant, Sarah Smith, joins Dave Prior to dig into the idea of "Feedback Is A Gift."  During the podcast, they unpack different ways to receive feedback, tips for giving it as well as how to figure out what to do with it once you get it, and what to do with the feedback that feels like a regifted Fruitcake. And also how to make sure you aren't the one doing the re-gifting.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Last week, the biggest conference in the Agile industry took place in Washington DC at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center. We were proud to be a sponsor of this event and we were even more excited about catching up with friends—both old and new. For those of you who couldn't make it to the conference, we wanted to give you a little taste of what it's all about, so we decided to live-stream our podcast out of our booth in the Prince George Exhibitor Hall.
We had a chance to talk to a lot of really smart and interesting people while we were there; some who were speaking at the conference, others who were simply attending, and even a few who were involved in turning this event into a reality.
Here are some of the highlights from day two.
In this live talk with Carlos Oliveira of adaptiveX, we discuss the topic of his Agile 2019 session: The Power of Design Sprints. Carlos shares how Design Sprints help teams solve big problems and test ideas by combining the “greatest hits” of Agile, Lean and Design Thinking.]]></itunes:summary>

<p>We had a chance to talk to a lot of really smart and interesting people while we were there; some who were speaking at the conference, others who were simply attending, and even a few who were involved in turning this event into a reality.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from day two.</p>
<p class="p1">In this live talk with Linda Rising, we discuss learnings from the book Thinking Fast and Slow, and how to use Daniel Kahneman’s research-supported approach to do a better job of thinking as an individual as well as working better together to think in groups.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes features 2 questions recently submitted by students from our CSM and CSPO classes. LeadingAgile’s Sarah Smith and I respond to the questions, sharing our thoughts, recommended practices, and things to watch out for.</p>
<p>The two questions are:</p>
<p>1. Is it okay for the ScrumMaster to take on additional (non-ScrumMaster) work during the Sprint?
2. When you have unfinished work at the end of a Sprint, does it automatically carry over into the next Sprint, and should you re-estimate it before you begin working on it again?</p>
<p>In responding to the first question we discuss the potential impact of planning for the SM to take on non-SM work during the Sprint, how that can impact the team’s ability to deliver and, if the SM takes on additional work, what should that work be?</p>
<p>The second question focuses on the situation where you get to the end of the Sprint, you have partially completed work and many teams will automatically push that into the next Sprint. If you have partially completed work, let’s say it is a User Story that was originally estimated using Story Points, and it was an 8. If there are only a few minutes of work needed to complete that item in a future Sprint, why do some teams feel the urge to give it a new Story Point estimate (based on work remaining) and what impact does that behavior have on the Scrum Team’s velocity?</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This episode of SoundNotes features 2 questions recently submitted by students from our CSM and CSPO classes. LeadingAgile’s Sarah Smith and I respond to the questions, sharing our thoughts, recommended practices, and things to watch out for.
The two questions are:
1. Is it okay for the ScrumMaster to take on additional (non-ScrumMaster) work during the Sprint?2. When you have unfinished work at the end of a Sprint, does it automatically carry over into the next Sprint, and should you re-estimate it before you begin working on it again?
In responding to the first question we discuss the potential impact of planning for the SM to take on non-SM work during the Sprint, how that can impact the team’s ability to deliver and, if the SM takes on additional work, what should that work be?
The second question focuses on the situation where you get to the end of the Sprint, you have partially completed work and many teams will automatically push that into the next Sprint. If you have partially completed work, let’s say it is a User Story that was originally estimated using Story Points, and it was an 8. If there are only a few minutes of work needed to complete that item in a future Sprint, why do some teams feel the urge to give it a new Story Point estimate (based on work remaining) and what impact does that behavior have on the Scrum Team’s velocity?
If you have follow-up questions for Sarah or Dave, here is how you can reach them:

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, we tackle the question of whether or not it's a good idea for the Development Team to limit the size of work brought into a Sprint. Many teams consider this to be a valuable practice during Sprint Planning or when creating a Definition of Ready. The goal is to make sure that the Development Team is not committing work into a Sprint that they cannot complete during the course of a Sprint. This often shows up as something like “Nothing bigger than an 8” (for teams using Fibonacci to estimate User Story Points). While this practice can be valuable for the Development Team, it also has an impact on the Product Owner and how they prepare work for Sprint Planning.</p>
<p>During the podcast, LeadingAgile SVP and Executive Consultant, Scott Sehlhorst and Senior Consultant Andrew Young talk with Dave about whether or not this practice actually helps and how it can become an impediment for the Product Owner who is trying to plan out work for the Release.</p>
<p>Note from Dave: </p>
<p>This conversation was very impactful for me in terms of how I think about “ready” and how I think about the work done by the PO in getting ready for the Sprint. Limiting the size of work brought into a Sprint has always been something I have advocated for because I think it helps the Development Team, but I’ve never taken the time to think about how it might create challenges for the PO, who may be far more concerned about the Release than the Sprint.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Julianne Jones is a Principal Consultant with LeadingAgile. Her work includes interfacing with the leaders of high profile organizations and pairing with them in order to help Transform their organization to achieve true Business Agility. She's also someone who believes in giving back to the Agile community. Recently, Julianne spent a week serving as the ScrumMaster for the volunteers that helped put on the 2019 North American Global Scrum Gathering.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Julianne shares some details about her experience volunteering for the Scrum Alliance. She talks about the work she did in Austin acting as a servant leader for the many people who gave their time in order to make the North American Global Scrum Gathering one of the most valuable Agile events to take place each year. During the interview, Dave and Julianne discuss why volunteering for professional organizations is so important, the benefits you receive as a reward for your time, and what it’s like to spend a few days coming together with dedicated people who want to commit their time to ensure that the people who come to the Scrum Gathering have the best possible experience.</p>
Note from Dave:
<p>Volunteering for professional organizations like the Scrum Alliance and the Agile Alliance is one of the most powerful things you can do to develop your career. By offering your time, you get the opportunity to engage with people who are truly dedicated to Transforming the world of work. It's also one of the best ways you can develop a large network of like-minded individuals who you can turn to for support when you face challenging situations in Agile or when you are looking for a new gig.</p>

<p>Sara and Dave discuss different approaches to helping leadership understand the importance of Sprint Reviews and why their participation is so necessary for delivering a successful product. They also explore different techniques for responding to requests/demands that include unrealistic timelines and ways to begin coaching leadership into prioritizing the work, so that if a date commitment is established, the team can maximize the value they can deliver by the deadline.</p>

<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Managing Consultant, Jeff Howey, spends time talking with Dave about what a “well-formed backlog” actually is. Jeff and Dave discuss characteristics of a well-formed backlog, how you know if you’ve got one and why that's so important.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>When we develop products, we're responsible for maximizing the value we deliver to the customer. In order to do this, we have to understand who we're actually building the products for. We need to know who the customer is, what problem(s) we're trying to solve for them,  and any additional information we can gather that will give us more insight into their needs and how we can address them. We also need to have an awareness of where our assumptions about the customer may be introducing risk. Unfortunately, we often get so focused on creating and delivering that this area of focus doesn't receive the level of attention that's needed to ensure that we're solving the right problem(s) in the best way possible.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile SVP and Executive Consultant, Scott Sehlhorst makes the case for why this work is so important and why empathy maps are such a critical (and often ignored) aspect of this work. Scott and Dave talk through a step-by-step approach you can use to deepen your understanding of the customer and their needs, as well as how to make sure the solution you are working on is the right one and how to manage your risk by tracking and testing your assumptions and biases along the way.</p>
<p>If you're skeptical about the value that empathy maps provide, or how important it is to take the time to collect, analyze, and test information about your customer, this podcast is for you. And if you're looking for a detailed explanation of how to go about figuring all this out, this conversation may provide you with the blueprint you need to get started making sure you actually know who it is you're trying to “delight” with the products you create.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Agile Transformation, every organization has to deal with things in the system that are blocking them from developing an Agile System of Delivery. Impediments to Transformation exist at many levels: organizations, architectural, cultural, etc. Many of these impediments are common across companies and can be known and planned for ahead of time. In LeadingAgile's approach, there are 3 Things that are necessary for an organization to be capable of an Agile approach. Those 3 Things are stable teams, a well-formed backlog, and the ability to deliver a working tested increment of product on a regular basis. Anything that gets in the way of these 3 Things must be addressed as part of the Transformation.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Founder and CEO, Mike Cottmeyer, and Dave Prior discuss what a System of Transformation, some of the more common impediments to Agile Transformation, and ways to cope with those impediments.</p>
<p>This episode is a follow up to the podcast: <a href='https://www.leadingagile.com/podcast/system-of-delivery-vs-system-of-transformation/'>System of Delivery vs. System of Transformation</a>.</p>

Those 3 Things are stable teams, a well-formed backlog, and the ability to deliver a working tested increment of product on a regular basis. Anything that gets in the way of these 3 Things must be addressed as part of the Transformation.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Founder and CEO, Mike Cottmeyer, and Dave Prior discuss what a System of Transformation, some of the more common impediments to Agile Transformation, and ways to cope with those impediments.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Metrics are important. Tracking work is important.  “What gets measured gets done." But, if you don’t understand why you're measuring things, or what the problem you're trying to solve when you begin measuring things—no amount of metrics is going to help.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Senior Consultant, Jessica Wolfe and Dave Prior talk about metrics and how important it is to understand what problem you're trying to solve when you begin using metrics to understand performance and improvement.  This interview is a follow up to a presentation Jessica gave recently at Agile Tampa called "<a href='https://www.meetup.com/tampa-bay-agile/events/258335791/'>Achieving Success with any Agile Planning Tool"</a>.</p>
<p>During the podcast, Jessica and Dave discuss some of the more common things organizations initially track when they're moving away from a traditional approach, what to be careful about when you begin using these metrics, how the metrics that you're focused on will evolve over time as you mature in your adoption of Agile, and what to do if you find yourself tracking information and you aren't sure why.</p>
Additional Information
<p>During the podcast, Jessica and Dave make a reference to how we design the tool to help the end users understand the new way of working in the LeadingAgile model, so we wanted to provide a couple of screenshots to assist you in seeing some of the possibilities. Here's an example of what the tool might look like at the Portfolio Tier on an Epic.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Organizations embracing an Agile approach to their work value their ability to inspect and adapt. They value the ability to continually learn and deepen their understanding of what problems they are trying to solve so that they can inspect and adapt toward a better solution. The challenge is that just because we're Agile and we want to inspect and adapt our way to a better solution doesn't mean that we can ignore the constraints of scope, cost, and time. Those constraints matter and we need to find the best solution possible within those constraints. Figuring out how to do that is no small thing.</p>
<p>In this week's podcast, LeadingAgile's Founder and CEO, Mike Cottmeyer spends some time talking with Dave Prior about how to maximize the value we're able to deliver in the presence of constraints.</p>

Those constraints matter and we need to find the best solution possible within those constraints. Figuring out how to do that is no small thing.</p>
<p>In this week's podcast, LeadingAgile's Founder and CEO, Mike Cottmeyer spends some time talking with Dave Prior about how to maximize the value we're able to deliver in the presence of constraints.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>When people talk about Agile, they often talk about the approach they are taking: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, SAFe, LeSS, DAD, Nexus, etc. These and the other frameworks and methodologies that could be considered to fall under the Agile umbrella are Systems of Delivery because they are techniques for delivering.</p>
<p>There's often an assumption that if we adopt the System of Delivery, our organization will Transform to Agile. Sometimes this happens, but often, organizations need more than a System of Delivery. They need a way to go about helping their organization evolve into a state where it's capable of realizing the benefits of the various Systems of Delivery. This journey from your current state, into a state that's capable of fully leveraging the System of Delivery, may actually require a System of Transformation.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, our CEO & Founder, Mike Cottmeyer spends some time with Dave digging into what a System of Transformation is, why this is different than a System of Delivery, how the two are connected, and why having a System of Transformation is such a critical part of your organization's ability to realize the benefits of taking an Agile approach to delivering work.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, on SoundNotes, we're featuring another question from a student in one of our Certified Scrum classes. The question came from someone who's working in an organization that doesn't see value in the role of Product Owner and isn't convinced that it's needed as part of the Scrum Team.</p>
<p>The question:</p>
<p>What is the worth of a good P.O.?</p>
<p>LeadingAgile Senior Consultant, Tim Wise spent some time with Dave talking through various aspects of the question. Together, Dave and Tim will explore the role of the P.O., the value a P.O. can add in an organization, and some contexts in which different aspects of the P.O. role might be solved through other means. Lastly, Dave and Tim will discuss how an organization that's focused on maximizing the value delivered to the customer might go about measuring the value of a Product Owner.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In one of my recent Certified Scrum Master classes, I had a number of students who were working on projects involving migrating from a legacy data warehouse to new data warehouses. Figuring out how to apply Scrum to the work they were doing presented a number of challenges and left some open questions.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of the data related topics that showed up in the Parking Lot:</p>
<ul><li>How do I apply Scrum to data factory?</li>
<li>As a Data Architect, I want to learn how Scrum applies to data factory so I can be part of a successful Dev. Team </li>
</ul>
<p>In talking with the students about the work they were doing, I was left with a question:</p>
<p>Is Scrum really the best option for this type of work?</p>
<p>While I'm able to understand the challenges they face—both with the work and applying Scum in this situation—my background does not include the necessary work experience to speak to this topic with any level of authority. Fortunately, at LeadingAgile I have many experts I can reach out to when I run into situations like this. LeadingAgile Senior Consultant, Dave Nicolette, was kind enough to spend some time digging into this topic with me.</p>
<p>If you are working on large scale data-related projects and trying to figure out how to use Agile to get the work done, this week’s SoundNotes should offer you some valuable tips.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, on SoundNotes, we've got Part 3 of a trio of interviews with LeadingAgile Chief Methodologist and Co-Founder Dennis Stevens. The series focuses on how to build an organization that can embrace change. In the final episode of the series, Dennis and Dave cover how to prioritize work being done to maximize return.</p>
<p>During the interview, they discuss how prioritization at all levels of the organization can support the ability to inspect and adapt and how some lingering traditional approaches to work, compensation, and prioritization can have a negative impact on your organization's ability to embrace change.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mikkel Ladegaard is a Senior VP and Executive Consultant with LeadingAgile. This week, on SoundNotes, Mikkel and Dave Prior discuss Mikkel's focus on designing product-centric organizations in which the company's strategic prioritization of work is implicit and decision-making can be localized at the team level. During the conversation, they unpack a range of issues related to this topic, including how favor-based economies work, what the value is in designing organizations where there is a separation between those who identify the problem and those who solve the problem, and what the benefits are in making sure your organization is managing value rather than resources.</p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mikkel Ladegaard is a Senior VP and Executive Consultant with LeadingAgile. This week, on SoundNotes, Mikkel and Dave Prior discuss Mikkel's focus on designing product-centric organizations in which the company's strategic prioritization of work is implicit and decision-making can be localized at the team level. During the conversation, they unpack a range of issues related to this topic, including how favor-based economies work, what the value is in designing organizations where there is a separation between those who identify the problem and those who solve the problem, and what the benefits are in making sure your organization is managing value rather than resources.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile's own Brandon Dudley—Senior Consultant—shares his experience making the shift from a Waterfall mindset to a more Agile way of thinking and working. Brandon got his start in traditional, PMI-centric, project management working in the auto industry in Detroit. His introduction to Agile didn't involve the hard break that many of us experience. For him, this was just another set of tools to help him get work done. During the podcast, Dave and Brandon talk through his experience of transforming his way of thinking about people and work and his advice for those on a similar journey.</p>
<p>Outside of work, one of Brandon’s biggest interests is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Mixed Martial Arts. The work he does there, both study and practice, have a significant impact on his view of work, how he interacts with people, and how he deals with challenging situations. This is a topic that Brandon and Dave dig into during the podcast as well.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[When we try to explain Agile, many of us begin by trying to describe some of the characteristics of how we approach work. We often talk about things like:
<ul><li>Limiting work in process</li>
<li>Delivering smaller increments of work</li>
<li>Reducing team size and empowering the teams to become cross-functional and self-organizing</li>
</ul>
These are all things that, from an Agile point of view, are good because they help us to focus on the most important things, optimize flow, localize decision making, and deliver the most important thing at a higher level of quality.
 
But, for those who are not familiar with our approach, what they may hear is
<ul><li>I can't have all the things I want</li>
<li>The things I do get will be smaller</li>
<li>I no longer have control of the people and how they work</li>
</ul>
A lot of this comes down to the words we use to convey the message.
 
This week's episode of SoundNotes is a discussion centered around the Language of Loss and the Language of Gain. During the podcast, you'll hear LeadingAgile Founder and CEO Mike Cottmeyer, Senior Consultant Andrew Young, and Dave Prior as they dig into the different levels of this topic. Together, the three of us will discuss how we can raise our awareness and shift the conversation to focus on what Agile gives, as opposed to what Agile takes.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes features, LeadingAgile Technical Consultant, Rich Dammkoehler in a conversation about why it is so important to make sure your organization is focused on improving their technical practices.</p>
<p>If you're struggling with helping your organization understand why introducing technical practices like collective code ownership, refactoring, pair programming, and test-driven development is such a crucial part of attaining business Agility; this podcast will help you build the case. Rich is a deeply experienced developer who got his start doing development using Waterfall and then found his way to Agile. In the Agile Transformation work that Rich does now, he focuses on helping organizations understand why and how the techniques and tools that came from Extreme Programming make them more effective at solving business problems and bring greater business success to the organization.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the interview, Rich also explains what it is that keeps him excited about doing development work after all these years, what development-related topics he is currently following the closest, and why punk rock is better than stadium rock.</p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes features, LeadingAgile Technical Consultant, Rich Dammkoehler in a conversation about why it is so important to make sure your organization is focused on improving their technical practices.</p>
<p>If you're struggling with helping your organization understand why introducing technical practices like collective code ownership, refactoring, pair programming, and test-driven development is such a crucial part of attaining business Agility; this podcast will help you build the case. Rich is a deeply experienced developer who got his start doing development using Waterfall and then found his way to Agile. In the Agile Transformation work that Rich does now, he focuses on helping organizations understand why and how the techniques and tools that came from Extreme Programming make them more effective at solving business problems and bring greater business success to the organization.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the interview, Rich also explains what it is that keeps him excited about doing development work after all these years, what development-related topics he is currently following the closest, and why punk rock is better than stadium rock.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>If your company is working on Agile Transformation, understanding how you can track the organization’s response to change and the impact it's having on business outcomes can be a bit daunting. It’s not so tough to track whether or not people have been trained and what practices they are using, but when it comes to understanding what people see, feel, believe, and desire, that can be harder to understand.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Managing Consultant, Jeff Howey and Dave Prior talk through some of the things you need to consider when trying to understand how change is taking root, how it's impacting what people think, how they work, and what they see, feel, believe, and desire.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Estimating work in Agile is something many people struggle to understand. It's not that it's an especially complicated thing, but there is often confusion about things like why many people prefer to use story points instead of hours, why some people feel compelled to try and convert story points to hours (and why some of us find that so frightening), how t-shirt sizing works, and the eternal question of how do I get my teams to estimate accurately.</p>
<p>Hint: </p>
<p>They're called estimates, not exactimates for a reason.</p>
<p>There's even a whole camp dedicated to the idea of notestimating work. So, if this is something you're struggling with, you're not alone.</p>
<p>This episode of SoundNotes is a brief tutorial on Agile Estimation and some of the ways you and your team could estimate work. The podcast offers some tips in general about Agile estimation, things to watch out for, how to estimate work using Story Points and Poker Planning, how to estimate work using T-shirt sizing, and–once you break your Product Backlog Items down into discrete tasks—how to estimate the using Ideal Hours. There are volumes that can be said about how to estimate work and a lot of fun "debates" to be had along the way, but if you're struggling to understand it, if you need to get a sense of whether your current approach makes sense, or if you just want a refresher on how to go about it, this podcast should give you plenty to start working with.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, Dennis Stevens and I recorded a podcast called <a href='https://www.leadingagile.com/podcast/building-an-organizational-system-that-can-embrace-change-w-dennis-stevens/'>Building an Organizational System That Can Embrace Change</a>. The podcast introduced three critical concepts which we are exploring at a deeper level in additional interviews.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Dennis Stevens, LeadingAgile’s co-founder and Chief Methodologist, and Dave Prior, dig into one of those key concepts:</p>
<p>How to design an execution model that can provide feedback which can then be incorporated back into the strategic planning.</p>
<p>If you're involved in making strategic decisions and planning at the program and portfolio level, there is a lot of valuable information here about how to reduce risk and create greater optionality for your organization.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>While many organizations would like to adopt an Agile approach, there are certain types that—due to the nature of their work and their relationship with the client—are not an easy fit with a process like Scrum. In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile Senior Consultants AJ Sanford and Andrew Fuqua explore how Process Maps and Value Stream Maps can help you gain greater clarity on where there are practices that need tuning and how Agile might be able to help. During the conversation, AJ, Andrew, and Dave also discuss the difference between Value Stream Maps and Process Maps and when one may be more helpful than another.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes features LeadingAgile’s Chief Methodologist and Co-Founder, Dennis Stevens, and focuses on how to build an organization that can embrace change.  The interview provides an overview of some of the key capabilities an Agile organization needs to accelerate learning, increase optionality, and improve their decision making including:</p>
<ul><li>How to incorporate market sensing capabilities into strategic planning</li>
<li>How to design an execution model that can provide feedback which can then be incorporated back into the strategic planning</li>
<li>How to prioritize the work being done to maximize return</li>
</ul>
<p>The interview digs into some of the steps an organization will need to take to develop these abilities and the challenges that come along with it. We also explore the impact on organizations that can’t remove all their internal dependencies, prioritizing risk to support learning, and the need for an organizational information broker that can collect and interpret the information coming out of the teams, so that the right information can be delivered back to the strategic level.</p>
<p>This is a heavy topic, so we’re planning on recording a few additional podcasts that will dig deeper in each of these individual topics.</p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes features LeadingAgile’s Chief Methodologist and Co-Founder, Dennis Stevens, and focuses on how to build an organization that can embrace change.  The interview provides an overview of some of the key capabilities an Agile organization needs to accelerate learning, increase optionality, and improve their decision making including:</p>
<ul><li>How to incorporate market sensing capabilities into strategic planning</li>
<li>How to design an execution model that can provide feedback which can then be incorporated back into the strategic planning</li>
<li>How to prioritize the work being done to maximize return</li>
</ul>
<p>The interview digs into some of the steps an organization will need to take to develop these abilities and the challenges that come along with it. We also explore the impact on organizations that can’t remove all their internal dependencies, prioritizing risk to support learning, and the need for an organizational information broker that can collect and interpret the information coming out of the teams, so that the right information can be delivered back to the strategic level.</p>
<p>This is a heavy topic, so we’re planning on recording a few additional podcasts that will dig deeper in each of these individual topics.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important things you can do for your team is to make sure you have a clearly defined, and well-documented, Definition of Done.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever seen footage of the flight control center when NASA launches a rocket you’ve seen a great example of a Definition of Done. Imagine what it would be like if NASA didn’t have all those stations that had to report in with “Go for launch” or “No Go for launch”. Imagine how that would work if we assumed we all had the same understanding of what "Ready for Launch" actually meant?</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Dave Prior is giving a tutorial on how to create a Definition of Done for your team. If you're following Scrum as it's defined, then “done” and potentially shippable are intended to be the same thing. Unfortunately, for many organizations, this isn't something that holds true. For example, your team may require additional integration testing that is done by a separate team and happens outside the Sprint. Yes, it’s dysfunctional from a Scrum perspective. Yes, you should try to fix it, but sometimes you’ve got what you’ve got and you're too fully consumed with other battles.</p>
<p>Over the course of the podcast, Dave talks about having clarity on three different levels of done. Here's what the three levels look like:</p>
<ol><li>Work that is “done” and can be presented to the Product Owner for Acceptance - this is an agreement between the PO and the Dev Team.</li>
</ol><p>Example:</p>
<ul><li>Code Complete</li>
<li>Test Cases are automated and executed</li>
<li>No defects</li>
<li>Acceptance Criteria Met</li>
<li>Pass Unit Testing</li>
<li>Pass Code Review</li>
<li>Documentation Complete as defined in Acceptance Criteria</li>
<li>Team knows how they will present feature during Sprint Review</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Work that is “done” and can be presented to Stakeholders in the Sprint Review</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul><li>Work has been presented to Product Owner</li>
<li>Product Owner Accepts as Potentially Shippable</li>
<li>Passes Previous Acceptance Tests</li>
<li>Demo Ready for Sprint Review</li>
<li>No Compile Warnings</li>
<li>Bugs Committed in Sprint Resolved</li>
<li>Deployment Docs Updated</li>
<li>Release Notes Updated</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Work that is “done” and can be actually shipped to customers.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul><li>Published to Stage Server</li>
<li>Passes Deployment Testing</li>
<li>Deployment Docs Delivered</li>
<li>Release Notes Delivered</li>
<li>Infrastructure Change Notes Delivered</li>
<li>Passes Performance Testing</li>
<li>Passes Security Audio</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t have a clearly defined, well-documented Definition of Done that you're updating every Sprint, you're putting your team and your organization in danger. If you don't already have a Definition of Done, you need one...and you need it now! In this episode of SoundNotes, Dave walks you through the creation of a Definition of Done.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode of LeadingAgile’s SoundNotes, we’ve got an interview/case study of sorts. Marty Bradley, Greg King, and Jessica Wolfe share the story of how they were able to leverage tooling and reporting in support of the transformation effort at one of LeadingAgile’s clients. In telling the story, they explain what was in place when they began the transformation, the data elements they used to help create awareness and transparency at the beginning of the project, and how the reporting evolved over time. They also discuss how some of the more popular metrics, like velocity, cannot tell a story alone. Understanding what is actually happening may require that you examine  multiple data points at the same time.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[LeadingAgile's CFO, Paul Argiry, will be at Agile 2018 to lead a session on Addressing Your CFO's Concerns To An Enterprise-Wide Agile Transformation. In this episode of LeadingAgile's SoundNotes, Paul offers a preview of the session he'll be leading in San Diego.
During the interview, Paul and Dave discuss why it's so important to understand what your CFO's concerns are when it comes to making the case for—or tracking progress towards—Agile Transformation. They also touch on the level of financial literacy that we should be expecting Agile coaches to have.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are working at an organization that is applying Agile practices across the enterprise, chances are,  somewhere early on in the transformation a tool was selected to help the teams manage their work and hopefully provide management with some kind of visibility into the work being done. One of the unfortunate truths about the tools is that while they are capable of doing a lot of things, most companies do not invest the time in setting the tool up to work for them. This often leads to teams struggling with having to adjust their practices to meet the tool and management not getting the visibility it needs into how the work is going.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>The tools can add a lot of value, but you have to get them set up right for that to happen.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Jessica Wolfe shares a story about how she was able to help one organization adjust the tool to provide the business with the information the CEO needed to understand how work was progressing across the portfolio and how it was tying back to the company’s strategic objectives.</p>
<p>As they dig into the story, Jessica and Dave explore what kinds of information the tools are able to provide, and how that can help your organization understand what is happening at a level of detail that includes strategic value, financial metrics, risk and much more.</p>
<p>She also manages to completely change Dave’s long mistrust of anything other than post-its and sharpies.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Dean Stevens and Dave Prior dig into Capability Mapping, how it works and why it is such an important part of the transforming your organization.</p>
<p>Capability Mapping is a technique that can be used to quickly gain greater awareness of how an organization does what it does, what processes it uses to do what it does, and where there are opportunities to remove waste and optimize flow.</p>
<p>During the interview you’ll hear Dean walk through the steps of identifying the processes an organization has in place, understanding the value each process provides, and finding ways to optimize these processes for better performance. This approach will also help identify gaps your organization may need to resolve in order to achieve its’ goals.</p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Dean Stevens and Dave Prior dig into Capability Mapping, how it works and why it is such an important part of the transforming your organization.</p>
<p>Capability Mapping is a technique that can be used to quickly gain greater awareness of how an organization does what it does, what processes it uses to do what it does, and where there are opportunities to remove waste and optimize flow.</p>
<p>During the interview you’ll hear Dean walk through the steps of identifying the processes an organization has in place, understanding the value each process provides, and finding ways to optimize these processes for better performance. This approach will also help identify gaps your organization may need to resolve in order to achieve its’ goals.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>For any organization moving to Agile, the question of how to handle tracking and reporting is going to present challenges. If you are moving from a traditional environment, there may be an expectation (dependency) on traditional forms of reporting. If you are starting out with an electronic tool, there may be a wide range of reporting options.</p>
<p>Just because you an create a report, does not mean you should. If your audience doesn't know how to digest the information, you may create cognitive dissonance and (cue inner Yoda voice) dissonance leads to confusion leads to fear, fear leads to "help". #thatwassarcasm</p>
<p>Derek Huether recently put up two blog entries that dig into come of the challenges that come with determining what to track and how to report on it.   In this episode of SoundNotes, Derek and Dave pick up the conversation but come at it from a different angle.  If your PMO is stuck the middle of some quasi-agile/waterfall environment and trying to figure out how to provide meaningful information to the folks upstairs, this podcast may be able to help.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>For Development Teams transitioning to Agile one common challenge is breaking the work down into small vertical slices that can go from a Post-It Note to shippable product in 2-3 days. Most of the time, (there are always exceptions) the issue is not that the work cannot be broken down, but that the Development Team is accustomed to looking at the work in a more traditional way and they are not able to see how they could break it down into smaller actionable elements that can be developed independently and provide value and the opportunity to learn.</p>
<p>If you're working with a team that is struggling with this, and you do not come from a technical background, the issue may be even more daunting. Without the in-depth knowledge of how the work might be executed, many people will feel ill-at-ease challenging the Dev Team's assertion that the work is just that big and can't be broken down.</p>
<p>In this podcast, Tim Wise and Dave Prior take on the topic of what to do when the Development Team can't break down the work. They share how they've each approached this challenge with teams and offer some ideas about how you could help your team find a way to break the work down.</p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Development Teams transitioning to Agile one common challenge is breaking the work down into small vertical slices that can go from a Post-It Note to shippable product in 2-3 days. Most of the time, (there are always exceptions) the issue is not that the work cannot be broken down, but that the Development Team is accustomed to looking at the work in a more traditional way and they are not able to see how they could break it down into smaller actionable elements that can be developed independently and provide value and the opportunity to learn.</p>
<p>If you're working with a team that is struggling with this, and you do not come from a technical background, the issue may be even more daunting. Without the in-depth knowledge of how the work might be executed, many people will feel ill-at-ease challenging the Dev Team's assertion that the work is just that big and can't be broken down.</p>
<p>In this podcast, Tim Wise and Dave Prior take on the topic of what to do when the Development Team can't break down the work. They share how they've each approached this challenge with teams and offer some ideas about how you could help your team find a way to break the work down.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the common misconceptions about Agile is that there's no documentation. This simply isn't true. The second line of the Agile Manifesto reads:</p>
<p>“Working software over comprehensive documentation”</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that we don’t have documentation. It just means that the folks who created the manifesto did not see the value in delivering the documentation at the expense of delivering working, tested software.</p>
<p>In a recent Certified ScrumMaster class in NYC, one student raised an issue she was experiencing with her Development Team who is deeply committed to the “no documentation” camp. In this podcast, Dave Prior is joined by Anil Jaising (who helped to facilitate the New York class) to discuss the myth of no documentation, the truth about documentation in Agile, and how that can play out in a highly regulated/audited environment.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago Dave Nicolette put up a blog post in FieldNotes called "Putting the Journey Into Journeyman" (<a href='https://tinyurl.com/ybehorv7'>https://tinyurl.com/ybehorv7</a>). I really enjoyed the post and wanted to ask Dave some additional questions about the idea of a Journeyman, how to reach that state, and what happens once you get there.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Dave and I discuss what a Journeyman is, and what a Journeyman isn't. We discuss the skills LeadingAgile expects from a software Journeyman, how to know if you've reached this state, and what you should expect to happen after you get there and each one of the states that comes after Journeyman. (Oh Look!  A Squirell!)</p>
<p>This podcast is also a great resource if you have been interviewing with LeadingAgile and you'd like to get a handle on the mindset of the folks who work here and what we expect of one another.</p>
<p>If you'd like to check out Dave's original blog post, you can find it here: "Putting the Journey Into Journeyman" -<a href='https://tinyurl.com/ybehorv7'>https://tinyurl.com/ybehorv7</a> </p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago Dave Nicolette put up a blog post in FieldNotes called "Putting the Journey Into Journeyman" (<a href='https://tinyurl.com/ybehorv7'>https://tinyurl.com/ybehorv7</a>). I really enjoyed the post and wanted to ask Dave some additional questions about the idea of a Journeyman, how to reach that state, and what happens once you get there.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Dave and I discuss what a Journeyman is, and what a Journeyman isn't. We discuss the skills LeadingAgile expects from a software Journeyman, how to know if you've reached this state, and what you should expect to happen after you get there and each one of the states that comes after Journeyman. (Oh Look!  A Squirell!)</p>
<p>This podcast is also a great resource if you have been interviewing with LeadingAgile and you'd like to get a handle on the mindset of the folks who work here and what we expect of one another.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Culture is just the boogeyman people use when they don't know how to articulate an organizational change management strategy that executives will buy into.”
 ~ Mike Cottmeyer</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile CEO, Mike Cottmeyer shares his thoughts on why we need to stop blaming culture when organizations are unable to adopt Agile. During the interview, Mike and Dave dig into the reasons why many of the organizations that struggle with Agile are dealing with deeply rooted mechanisms that extend far beyond culture. Unfortunately, one of the most common refrains in the Agile community is that the culture is the primary thing that must be addressed, and once that is solved, the rest will take care of itself. For many organizations that buy into the promise of Agile without having clarity on the organizational impediments they must overcome for Agile to be able to exist, maybe culture isn't the best place to start.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes features a question submitted by a student in one of Dave's recent CSPO classes. Maheesh’s question centers on how to apply Scrum on a project that involves BI reporting and ETL. Since Jessica Wolfe and Derek Huether both have far more experience in that type of work than Dave does, he asked them to help him respond to the question.</p>
<p>Here's the question we got from Maheesh:</p>
<p>“As a Product Owner for a BI reporting platform I typically get requests for new reports and this might entail bringing the data from a CRM platform or any other platform into the data warehouse so that that requires building ETL for that and developing the report on top of that. Which typically cannot be done within a two week Sprint. So how would I go about taking this requirement from the customer and converting into shippable user stories that can be delivered through a Scrum methodology?”</p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes features a question submitted by a student in one of Dave's recent CSPO classes. Maheesh’s question centers on how to apply Scrum on a project that involves BI reporting and ETL. Since Jessica Wolfe and Derek Huether both have far more experience in that type of work than Dave does, he asked them to help him respond to the question.</p>
<p>Here's the question we got from Maheesh:</p>
<p>“As a Product Owner for a BI reporting platform I typically get requests for new reports and this might entail bringing the data from a CRM platform or any other platform into the data warehouse so that that requires building ETL for that and developing the report on top of that. Which typically cannot be done within a two week Sprint. So how would I go about taking this requirement from the customer and converting into shippable user stories that can be delivered through a Scrum methodology?”</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of SoundNotes is all about Vision Statements. Dave Prior offers his thoughts on why they're so critical to the success of your team and how to go about putting one together.</p>
<p>One of the most important things a Product Owner can do to help the Development Team deliver value for the customer is to make sure they have clarity on the context of the problem they are trying to solve. If the Dev Team is just being given User Stories, and there's no understanding of the problem-space in which the story lives, it's going to be much harder for the Dev Team to make the choices that will maximize value for the customer.</p>
<p>Also, Vision Statements are one of the best ways a Product Owner can make sure that all the stakeholders are in agreement about what problem is being solved, who it's helping, and why it matters. If the Vision Statement is documented and agreed upon by all the stakeholders, it is going to be a lot easier to keep them in sync with one another.</p>
<p>Listen as Dave presents two very popular templates that can be used to create Vision Statements and walks you through how to go about putting them together.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of LeadingAgile’s SoundNotes, Derek Huether and Dave Prior take on the topic of Leading and Lagging Indicators. During the podcast they discuss how Key Performance indicators can help guide you towards an understanding of what to track with the expectation that it will create a certain result in the future (leading indicators), and what to measure in order to confirm if that result has in fact occurred (lagging indicators).</p>
<p>One example they touch on in the podcast is:  if you are trying to lose weight, tracking things like how much you exercise and how many calories you are consuming each day are leading indicators because it is reasonable to expect that if you are exercising regularly and limiting your caloric intake, that these actions could result in you losing weight. This is a way of tracking the actions you are taking to in order to bring about a desired change. But, we still need a way to confirm if the desired result has actually occurred. The only way you will know if you have actually lost weight, is to climb up on the scale and check your weight. That is a lagging indicator because it confirms whether or not the actions you took had resulted in the desired outcome.</p>

                      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of LeadingAgile’s SoundNotes, Derek Huether and Dave Prior take on the topic of Leading and Lagging Indicators. During the podcast they discuss how Key Performance indicators can help guide you towards an understanding of what to track with the expectation that it will create a certain result in the future (leading indicators), and what to measure in order to confirm if that result has in fact occurred (lagging indicators).</p>
<p>One example they touch on in the podcast is:  if you are trying to lose weight, tracking things like how much you exercise and how many calories you are consuming each day are leading indicators because it is reasonable to expect that if you are exercising regularly and limiting your caloric intake, that these actions could result in you losing weight. This is a way of tracking the actions you are taking to in order to bring about a desired change. But, we still need a way to confirm if the desired result has actually occurred. The only way you will know if you have actually lost weight, is to climb up on the scale and check your weight. That is a lagging indicator because it confirms whether or not the actions you took had resulted in the desired outcome.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode of SoundNotes, Derek Huether and Dave Prior respond to a question from a student who works in a long-standing supply chain organization that wants to move to Agile, but has questions about how to get started.</p>
<p>Here's the question:</p>
<p>I took your scrum master class and your product owner class a couple weeks ago and I got a lot out of it. Thanks so much for everything you did for everyone in the class. </p>
<p>After taking the class I was thinking about how I could apply what I’ve learned to my organization and to all of our customers who are thinking about implementing Scrum Teams in their supply chain organizations. </p>
<p>So, what my question is for you Dave is, what do you think is needed for an organization to transform to develop an Agile mindset across the organization and develop successful scrum teams? </p>
<p>I’d imagine that new organizations have the benefit of not having a status quo to compare it to so you don’t have to deal with change so they can start with Agile mindsets and they can start Scrum teams from the get go, but organizations that have been established and have been around for decades and even centuries have the challenge of having a traditional way of doing things. </p>
<p>So they have to get over the change management and implementing and changing the way they think… it seems like a lot to do for an organization so I’m curious to see what your thoughts are on what an organization that’s established…what they should do?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week Jessica Wolfe and Dave Prior respond to a question about how to be an effective ScrumMaster when you are not in the same location as your team. To complicate matters even more, try stepping into the ScrumMaster role in place of an SM who was colocated with part of the team.  If that doesn’t seem challenging enough—try two Product Qwners working with the team.</p>
<p>Here is the question:</p>
<p>My Scrum team consists of 4 devs in San Diego and 3 devs and 2 POs remotely (I know, breaking a rule right there having 2 POs and multiple projects assigned to one team) The previous scrum master for our team was located in San Diego and was able to have actual facetime with the portion of the team 2 times a week on average. Tuesday for Daily Scrum and Wednesdays for Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Planning (and then off week's Daily Scrum and Backlog Refinement). While we do everything virtually (Sprint backlog, Product Backlog, screenshare ceremonies encouraging video (but not required)), it was something the team welcomed, it was a rallying day, and I believe allowed the SM a better check on the morale/heartbeat of over half the team - seeing them in person, having easier one on one time available if needed. I have now taken over as SM for this team and another team (other team is all remote and they never met in person regularly), so I'm wondering if you might have any suggestions to foster that same closeness, continue to keep a close pulse on the team and provide a safe environment for openness and collaboration while serving the team from across the country.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>As organizations continue to grow and evolve in their practice of Agile, what they expect from Agile transformation coaches continues to evolve as well. Ten years ago, an Agile coach was someone who had enough experience working with Agile to help others pick up the basic habits and avoid some common mistakes. Today, we need a lot more.</p>
<p>In this episode of SoundNotes, Mike Cottmeyer talks with Dave Prior about how the needs and expectations of coaching have changed over the last 10 years. During the interview, Mike explains how LeadingAgile has evolved its understanding of the specific areas of skill and expertise the company needs to focus on when talking with transformation coaches during the interview process. Dave and Mike also discuss how coaches can address some of these gaps, and why it is so important to understand what type of coaching you are passionate about and how to leverage that.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We frequently get questions from clients who are transitioning to Agile when they begin working through the challenge of determining which roles are the best fit for individuals in their organization. Since many of our clients begin their Agile journey by taking on Scrum, the question usually shows up as:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Who should I make a Product Owner and who should I make a ScrumMaster?</p>
<p>While there is no locked down definition of who should transition into what role, there are some standard patterns that appear across organizations. A lot of it though depends on how an organization views the individuals in those positions and what level of responsibility they are given by the company.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s podcast, LeadingAgile’s Jim Hayden and Tim Wise join Dave to respond to questions submitted by students from our CSM and CSPO classes:</p>
Question 1: How PBIs Get Into The Product Backlog
<p>"Quick question. I was wondering if you had any ideas around a process for getting items into a backlog? I currently just stepped into a role and one of the first things I'm wanting to tackle is a process for placing items into our backlog. Currently things are all over the place because the developers are kind of doing their own thing . In order to create some consistency among PBI's do you think it's a good idea for one individual (ME) to create all PBI's? It's a fairly small team with 6 developers so I don't anticipate any bottle neck. If you don't think having one individual is a good idea then what recommendations do you have for putting a process in place for my team?" (Begins at 02:37)</p>
Question 2: Moving to Waterfall From Agile
<p>"The only thing we didn't have time to talk about was how to manage transitions from waterfall to agile.  Will you please send me or upload to the box (if you haven't already done it) some tips/techniques/advices about how to handle that process?" (Begins at 19:31)</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Scrum Alliance’s Certified Scrum Professional (CSP) designation is changing on Jan 1, 2018. If you meet the qualifications for the current version of CSP, applying before it expires on December 31, 2017 may provide you with a much easier path to the practitioner level of certification offered by the Scrum Alliance.</p>
<p>You’ll find details on the current version of CSP here:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/practitioners/csp-certification'>https://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/practitioners/csp-certification</a></p>
<p>In order to qualify for CSP there are a number of requirements that must be met including earning 70 Scrum Education Units (SEUs).</p>
<p>With the pending change, I have been recommending to all my CSM and CSPO students that they apply for CSP as soon as possible in order to beat the deadline. Many of them have come back with questions about how to earn the SEUs required for the CSP designation.</p>
<p>In this podcast, Scrum Alliance Director of Global Learning and Assessment, <a href='https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/ejones20'>Erika Massie</a> and Scrum Alliance Learning Coordinator, <a href='https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/cwanberg'>Cody Wanberg</a> break down the changes to the CSP certification, the timeline for the change AND we talk through different ways to attain the required SEU’s before the deadline.</p>
<p>It’s a short podcast, so no actual show notes for this one. Just a few things to keep in mind…</p>
<ul><li>In order to qualify for CSP before the change, you must have your completed application submitted to the Scrum Alliance before it becomes 2018 in Denver.</li>
<li>Once you submit, the turnaround time you should expect is 8 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few of the ways you can earn SEUs…</p>
<ul><li>Watch the CST facilitated webinars on the Scrum Alliance website. There are 19 of these and they are an hour each. If you watch them all, you’ll earn 19 SEUs.</li>
<li>Watch the Scrum Foundations e-learning series to earn 1 SEU.</li>
<li>If you took a CSM or CSPO, each class is worth 16 SEUs. If you’ve taken both, that is 32. AND, if you’ve taken CSM or CSPO more than once, you get the 16 for each time you take the class.</li>
<li>During the interview, Cody and Erika explain that listening to something like the <a href='http://podcast.agileuprising.com/manifesto-author-review/'>Agile Uprising’s Manifesto Author Review podcast series</a> could be submitted under Category E - Independent Learning. You get 1 SEU for each hour of time spent listening. It is a great series and I highly recommend it. You can find it here.</li>
<li>There are a number of additional ways to earn SEUs and you can find that detailed on the Scrum Alliance site. <a href='https://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/practitioners/csp-certification/ways-to-earn-seus'>https://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/practitioners/csp-certification/ways-to-earn-seus</a></li>
</ul>
Additional Questions
<p>If you have questions for the Scrum Alliance about the changes to CSP or SEU’s, send an email to <a href='mailto:support@scrumalliance.org'>support@scrumalliance.org</a> with the subject line CSP Application Question</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In October, LeadingAgile SVP, Scott Sehlhorst spent some time talking with Dave about the importance of Personas and Proto-Personas and how to use them. In this episode of SoundNotes, Scott is back to talk about Empathy Maps, how they work, why they are so valuable and how to create one. During the conversation, Scott and Dave talk through each step of creating an Empathy Map. The podcast is one of our longer ones, but if you are seeking a better understanding of how to put one together, you’ll find a lot of valuable information in this interview.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>For this episode of SoundNotes, we’re back with more of the questions submitted by recent  CSM and CSPO students.</p>
<p>In this week’s podcast, Jessica Wolfe and Dave Prior respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>What is the desired relationship interaction between the Scrum Master and Development Managers with regard to developers who are participating on a scrum team, and how does that impact performance management from an HR standpoint? In other words, if there are performance issues with a Developer, where does the responsibility fall for addressing & resolving those performance issues?</p>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<p>I work at a fairly large company on a product that has direct eyesight from the CEO, who constantly says things like, “Wouldn’t it be cool if our app did X?” with the expectation being that it doesn’t matter how cool X actually is, we can expect to be implementing it right frickin’ now. How, for the love of SCRUM can I deal with this within my framework?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the best parts of working at LeadingAgile is the continual focus on helping the brilliant people who work here amplify their ability to deliver value for customers. We have a weekly call where we focus on different aspects of the work we do and how we can get better at delivering on the LeadingAgile approach so that our customers can achieve their goals. In a recent call Mike Cottmeyer walked through the Trust Influence Loop, which explains the way we interact with our clients in order to develop the safety and trust we need to be able to help them achieve the outcomes they are looking for. The model had a huge impact on me and I asked Mike if he’d be willing to do an interview on it so that we could share it with others.  While this podcast is a little on the long side, the whole conversation is incredibly valuable.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>For this episode of SoundNotes, we reached out to some of the students who have taken CSM and CSPO classes over the last few months. We got a lot of great questions and will be responding to them over the next few weeks. This week, Derek Huether and Dave Prior respond to these two questions:</p>
Question 1:
<p>My team seems to have a problem with estimating and understanding the estimating concepts.  The team members are accustomed to traditional waterfall projects and estimating everything in units of time.  How can I help them understand estimating, but continue to complete the sprints with no pbis rolling over to the next sprint?</p>
Question 2:
<p>I have a team lead who is skeptical of scrum, especially metrics related to the process. He doesn’t think carryover matters from sprint to sprint as long as we’re “creating value” and getting the program priorities completed. Any advice on how to convince him that metrics can be a tool for good, and that the sanctity of the sprint commitment matters?</p>

The session I led was called Hacking Agile for Digital Agencies and the canvas tool I built for the session is intended to help Digital Agencies understand more about why they want to use Agile practices in the first place, how they are expected to help and what they are willing to risk in order to achieve some level of agility.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>During a recent LeadingAgile offsite Jeff Vogelsang and Tom Churchwell sat down with Dave Prior to break down the TIES approach of Agile planning that they have bee using with clients. This approach been used to help organizations who need a way to manage long term strategy planning that creates visibility all the way down to the execution level. TIES addresses planning at 4 levels:</p>
<ul><li>Themes – Strategic long term goals broken down into time boxes of 1 to 3 quarters.</li>
<li>Initiatives – Themes are broken down into elements that collectively address the theme. These are broken down into time boxes of 1 to 3 months.</li>
<li>Epics – Initiatives are broken down into Epics which would take between 1 to 3 sprints to deliver.</li>
<li>Stories – Epics are broken down into User Stories that are small enough to be completed by a Team within a Sprint, ideally within 1 to 3 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this interview Jeff and Tom explain the different level of planning TIES, how they work and how they can be used to help management understand their capacity to introduce more work.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this Agile 2017 interview Johanna Rothman talks with Dave about her new book “Create Your Successful Agile Project Collaborate, Measure, Estimate and Deliver” and how teams that are struggling to make Scrum work may want to adopt an approach that focuses on continuous flow in order to deliver value for their customers with greater frequency. The interview includes a conversation about working with User Stories that are sized to only take the team a single day to complete, how this can help teams that are struggling with estimation, and how Johanna’s approach to writing (she averages about 1 book a year in addition to posting to her blog every few days) involves writing for just 15 minutes a day.</p>

The interview includes a conversation about working with User Stories that are sized to only take the team a single day to complete, how this can help teams that are struggling with estimation, and how Johanna’s approach to writing (she averages about 1 book a year in addition to posting to her blog every few days) involves writing for just 15 minutes a day.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>At Agile 2017 Diana Larsen sat down with Dave Prior to talk about the Agile Fluency model. In this interview she explains what it is (a way of thinking about what benefits an organization needs to get from it’s teams) and how she and James Shore co-founded the Agile Fluency Project with the hope of moving past the question of whether or not a given team, practice, etc. was Agile or not. They wanted to shift the focus to a more positive approach that would help teams develop routine, skillful ease as they move further down the path of adopting agile practices with the ultimate goal of providing enough benefit to the organization so that they, in turn, receive the organizational support for continuous improvement.

Michael J. Tardiff is a conference veteran with a lot to say about most things. Watch as Dave and Michael talk about topics such as: networking while at the conference, some of the latest mergers in the industry, the legitimacy of norms, and even the Mexican government. The topics are varied, but the message is consistent. The Agile world is changing but is that change for the better.

David is a former Navy Submarine Commander and the author of the book "Turn the Ship Around A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders" (http://amzn.to/2v4yc1T). David gave a presentation at Agile 2017 about how his experiences in the Navy influenced his style of leadership. Being the loudest and clearest voice in the room and using swear words doesn’t necessarily mean you’re a great leader, neither does pretending you know all the answers. Sometimes the best way to lead is to learn to trust and empower the people on your teams. In this interview David talks about his experiences, the challenges of learning to trust, and his first hand experiences of seeing the powerful impact of intent-based leadership.

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Agile 2017 opened with a Keynote from David Marquet. David is a former Navy Submarine Commander and the author of the book "Turn the Ship Around A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders" (http://amzn.to/2v4yc1T). David gave a presentation at Agile 2017 about how his experiences in the Navy influenced his style of leadership. Being the loudest and clearest voice in the room and using swear words doesn’t necessarily mean you’re a great leader, neither does pretending you know all the answers. Sometimes the best way to lead is to learn to trust and empower the people on your teams. In this interview David talks about his experiences, the challenges of learning to trust, and his first hand experiences of seeing the powerful impact of intent-based leadership.

                      <description><![CDATA[At Agile 2017, LeadingAgile Principal Consultant, Rick Austin, will lead a session that focuses on how organizations can transform their Portfolio Management from an approach that is more closely aligned with waterfall to an approach that is better able to support Agile. In this podcast Rick outlines some of the key concepts he will be digging in to during the session and then he and Dave discuss some of the challenges that come along with this aspect of transformation, like governance, prioritization and how work flows through the organization.

                      <description><![CDATA[This week Devin Hedge joins Dave Prior for another student question. This time about architecture and if the complexity of it would be better served by a waterfall approach:

The Question:

"How to plan for the Architecture effectively. With waterfall, we try to figure out all aspects of the business and the technical solution in advance before we start development. In Agile, we discover as we go. It's very likely that when we come to a certain, we'll find either the current business logic or the current technical framework cannot adapt our upcoming demands. There's a high opportunity that we'll need to destroy all the work that we've done. Talking in this perspective, isn't waterfall better than Agile?"

Show Notes

00:08 Interview Begins
00:51 This week’s question
02:00 What do we mean by architecture
02:29 The design principles and standards you need in place to support your work
03:35 If it isn’t loosely coupled, neither waterfall or agile can really help
04:17 Challenging the assumption that big up front planning could help you eliminate the risk of having to do rework and whether or not waterfall is actually supposed to do that
07:43 If we can’t eliminate the risk of not knowing everything up front, what can you do?
08:30 Devin puts on his architect hat - guardrails and guideposts
09:53 Reframing the problem 
10:40 How physical building architects are still designing even after the building is built - you never know what the tenants of the building will actually want
11:48 The risk of making decisions too early
12:18 Advice from Devin on how to reduce your risk of designing architecture up front and put up the guardrails and guideposts you need
14:14 How architects look at the work and decision making
17:02 Making decisions at the last possible responsible moment
17:43 Having a growth mindset vs. a fixed mindset
19:10 Is there value in waiting to make your decisions until you have all the information? What is your cost of delay of waiting to make the decisions?
20:57 Devin’s upcoming events: Agile Budgeting and Cost Tracking for the PMI North Carolina Chapter on July 11 and PMI South Carolina on July 20

                      <description><![CDATA[One of the challenges many organizations face with Agile is how to handle long term strategic planning in a way that creates visibility all the way through to the execution level. TIES is an approach to Agile planning that can help the business engage in long term planning, understand their organization’s capacity to actually execute on the work, and then see how that work can be broken down into pieces that are sized to allow the individual teams to execute on them.

In this episode of SoundNotes, Tom Churchwell explains how TIES can help with Agile Planning. Using this approach the work is sized into:

 - Themes - Strategic long term goals broken down into time boxes of 1 to 3 quarters.
 - Initiatives - Themes are broken down into elements that collectively address the theme. These are broken down into time boxes of 1 to 3 months.
 - Epics - Initiatives are broken down into Epics which would take between 1 to 3 sprints to deliver.
 - Stories - Epics are broken down into User Stories that are small enough to be completed by a Team within a Sprint, ideally within 1 to 3 days.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Successfully completing a CSM or CSPO class doesn't impact everyone the same way. For some, it is like a lightbulb went off and everything about Agile just makes sense. For others (like me), some of the ideas and values from waterfall persist for a time. Questioning agile and trying to reconcile this new way of thinking with the old way is part of the personal journey of moving from a traditional approach to an agile way of working. I tend to think of it as a hangover that occurred from drinking a little too much waterfall. In this week's podcast, I address 3 questions that were submitted by a student following a recent class. These were the same kinds of questions I was asking when I took my CSM training and was getting my head around agile. In the podcast I address not only the questions that were asked, but the bigger ones that may be more subtext - around, why do we need to work this way? The questions: 1. What are the factors that lead us to the decision to go Agile or Waterfall? The simple "Scrum is best suited for complex projects" (page 10 of the workbook) doesn't seem to be enough and there could be challenges against that statement. The more complex the issue is, the more effort we would want to spend upfront instead of down the road. Is earlier we detect the issues the less cost to fix it? 2. We know a perfect scrum team should be cross functional but in reality, we're far from that. The question is how to fix the velocity gap between the roles to maximize their efficiency? E.g. developers code faster than testers (usually when the system is huge and a single change would require a lot of regression testing). We know we can fix it by adjusting the ratio among the roles but the amount of work changes overtime, if we keep adjusting the ratio we will NOT have a stable scrum team. 3. As User Stories do NOT contain the requirement details, the requirement is actually conveyed through discussion between PO vs Dev team, how can we capture the product specification? The Product Specification is extremely important for many purposes including training of new team member, doing impact analysis, or for PO to know how the current system works so they can plan for future improvement. Should we spend effort to compose/update Product Specs? If we do, will that be a User Story or just count it as overhead ? This is a pretty short podcast (less than 15 minutes) so I have not broken it down into timed show notes.

                      <description><![CDATA[This week Dave received a request for advice from a student in one of LeadingAgile’s Certified Scrum Product Owner classes: 

How to effectively work with a distributed scrum team (both time and distance). We have an IT Software project in which PO is in the US, Development is in Ukraine and Testing is in Vietnam.

ShowNotes 

A summary of the suggestions Dave and Derek offer during the podcast:

- Reorganize the team

- Have additional POs or BAs in each location

 - Set up a US based team of rockstar POs who organize themselves specifically to support this distributed effort

 - Spend more time in backlog refinement and try to eliminate risk by taking as much are as possible to make sure the PBI’s area clearly defined enough for the teams to work on them (largely) without needing additional questions answered

 - Bring the entire team together for a time to establish patterns of communication and personal relationship, with the idea being that they are together for a time to shorten the feedback loop while they practice working together so that they can manage it better when they all go back home.

 - Team offsites to build the connection and create empathy between the disparate parts of the team

 - Online interaction - like the recent TDD Mobbing exercise Dave participated in on Twitch for Agile Uprising (https://youtu.be/4HX0JrnHSjI)

                      <description><![CDATA[In this episode of SoundNotes, LeadingAgile’s Derek Huether and Dave Prior tackle a student question about how Scrum works with Marketing. In a recent class, a student names Cherie explained that in the work her Marketing Team does, it isn’t possible to achieve “potentially shippable” at the end of a Sprint. The Team may finish the work and the Product Owner may accept it, but nothing can actually be “shippable” until after the client has had a chance to review a work item and provide feedback or approval

Show Notes

00:08 Interview Begins
00:26 An update on Derek’s upcoming events
01:30 Topic Introduction 
01:59 Cherie’s Question about how Definition of Done works when you are using Scrum in Marketing if nothing can ship until after you have client approval
02:26 Derek and Dave respond
03:03 We’re going to have an argument here…
04:33 The difference between a more pure Definition of Done  and potentially shippable  vs. what often happens in the real world
05:23 Derek shares a story on his experience with this issue
06:51 SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT MAKING HER HAPPY!
07:24 Why you should not blame the client for not having total clarity on what they need
09:05 Is it a big deal if you can’t get “shippable” out of a sprint
09:48 It’s more important to get the customer something they can provide feedback on
10:20 Always be learning a little more than you knew yesterday 
10:52 Derek’s advice for things Sheri could do to remedy the situation
11:48 Try to make a smarter decision tomorrow than you could today 
12:15 Scrum is a feedback mechanism

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the second interview in a series we are doing on Cost of Delay. The first interview, where Jim Hayden provided an overview of Cost of Delay can be found here: http://bit.ly/2lUDWFR In Part 2 of the series, Marty Bradley explains how Cost of Delay actually works. During the interview we discuss things like Weighted Shorted Job First (WSJF), how to determine relative Business Value of different features or projects and how to evaluate that value against different factors like risk. During the interview Marty refers to two different graphics that help explain Cost of Delay. Here are links to the two graphic files*: The Formula for Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)https://www.dropbox.com/s/slfrifz9pqqqgex/WSJF%20Formula.jpg?dl=0 The Cost of Delay Table https://www.dropbox.com/s/9lwrd0tjs5wcmqy/WSJF%20Table.jpg?dl=0" * These graphics are based on examples Marty was referencing in the interview.

                      <description><![CDATA[This episode of LeadingAgile’s SoundNotes offers a case study of how the technology teams at NewSpring church have been using Agile practices to develop innovative products that will enable their members to stay engaged with NewSpring throughout the whole week. 

Jon Horton is the Web Director at NewSpring. A few weeks ago he and several members of his team attended a LeadingAgile CSM class. In the interview Jon explains how he introduced Scrum to the organization, how it is being adopted by the technology teams, how it impacts their ability to deliver value for NewSpring members and some of the challenges that they’ve faced along the way. 

This podcast offers a great case study of how Agile practices are extending beyond traditional software development teams and are being used to innovate and deliver value to all types of “customers”.

In the interview Jon explains how he introduced Scrum to the organization, how it is being adopted by the technology teams, how it impacts their ability to deliver value for NewSpring members and some of the challenges that they’ve faced along the way. 

This podcast offers a great case study of how Agile practices are extending beyond traditional software development teams and are being used to innovate and deliver value to all types of “customers”.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This podcast is the first in a series we intend to do on Cost of Delay. This podcast features LeadingAgile Enterprise Transformation Consultant, Jim Hayden, and Dave Prior discussing the ideas behind Cost of Delay at a fairly high level. If you are new to the subject, or are struggling with understanding it, this may help provide clarity on what Cost of Delay is and how it works. In a future podcast on this subject we will look at Cost of Delay from a more Reinertsen-centric viewpoint. We also plan to do at least one podcast that offers a case study on how Cost of Delay has been put into practice within an Agile organization. We will look at how they are using it to understand and prioritize work at the project, program and portfolio level.

                      <description><![CDATA[This episode of SoundNotes features two questions that were submitted recently by students. 

2:11 Question 1 - Design and Cross Functional Teams
Submitted by Sergey via Email : 
“Every time I hear you speak about cross-functional team I am not sure who these teams comprise of exactly. In my world the confusion here is most often related to design inputs. Any digital product will have a visual UI and thus its development will require design inputs. Do most of Leading Agile clients consider this a separate process that contributes to the readiness of stories for a technical Scrum team? Or do you normally assume designers are a part of a Scrum team?

In my view, the former creates waterfall-like dependencies and the latter gets in the way of confident estimations. So, even if both models are feasible, none of them seems ideal, because it leaves an are that has to be tightly managed.”

8:20 Question 2 - How do you deal with a manager who thinks you should be ScrumMaster for multiple teams AND Product Owner at the same time?

This question was submitted by a student in a CSPO class who allowed me to record the question being asked as long as I promised not to post the recording or identify the person by name. In order to honor that, I played the recording for Derek before hand, but in the podcast, what you’ll hear is me (Dave) relating the question. 

The question shared by the student related to the fact that they are currently playing the role of ScrumMaster on three  different teams and have also been asked to act as Product Owner for these teams. The person explained to their manager that the way Scrum is designed to work, a ScrumMaster is supposed to be dedicated to a single team, should definitely not be trying to support three teams and absolutely should not be playing the role of ScrumMaster and Product Owner at the same time. The manager responded by asking that the person give a detailed account what they are doing all day as a Scrum Master because the manager did not believe the person was too busy to be able to serve as ScrumMaster for three teams and Product Owner for as those teams as well. 

9:32 Derek and Dave respond and respond to the question.

                      <description><![CDATA[2017 is here and Mike Cottmeyer is ready. In this episode of SoundNotes, the CEO of LeadingAgile shares his thoughts on the primary issues facing organizations as they continue working to transform. There are many who claim culture is the main issue, but is that really the impediment to Organizational Agility?

ShowNotes

00:08 Interview Starts
00:47 How do you lead change in large organizations?
02:17 Is the biggest impediment to Agile really culture change? How do you do that at scale?
03:00 What is getting in the way of culture?
04:16 I can change my attitude and value system, but will the organization support that changed attitude and belief?
04:51 The mindset shift is just the starting point
07:15 How do you get 1,000 people to simultaneously have a mindset shift and then know what to go do
07:42 Is the industry still stuck? How do we get past wanting Agile to being able to do Agile?
08:12 A positive Agile culture has to be reinforced
10:07 The difference between culture and the basic actions you should do
11:29 Can you have the behavior without the culture system shift?
13:29 Can you use the mechanics to reach a desired end state without worrying about becoming Agile?
15:35 Where does Mike see the industry going in 2017?
19:49 Does the organization really need to understand how Agile works or can someone coach the organization into an Agile state?
22:02 How does the organization recognize the fundamentals of what needs to be changed to achieve Organizational Agility?
24:18 Does having data that explains the problem help strengthen the case for change?
25:10 Your organization is deeply flawed.
26:41 How are we going to measure that the problem was indeed solved?
28:07  The organizations are broken. Teaching them to want something is not enough. At some point you have to do the work.
30:00 If we teach culture change will people really self organize in the presence of constraints
31:19 Should everyone be more disruptive? Who designs the structure to support that?
32:18 Is there a point where you need to be more directive to help people become more Agile?
33:04 We are so myopically focused on self organization.
34:02 If i am an executive with limited time to learn and research, what do I focus on?
35:18 The problem is that people are overselling how Agile can work.
38:35 Do you want to do Agile on a team, or do you want to become an Agile organization?
39:08 How Agile do you need to be?
43:57 The music Mike has been listening to lately and is looking forward to listening to.
45:05 The one thing Mike wishes all the clients knew before he got into the room.
46:41 Closeout

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[2017 is here and Mike Cottmeyer is ready. In this episode of SoundNotes, the CEO of LeadingAgile shares his thoughts on the primary issues facing organizations as they continue working to transform. There are many who claim culture is the main issue, but is that really the impediment to Organizational Agility?

ShowNotes

00:08 Interview Starts
00:47 How do you lead change in large organizations?
02:17 Is the biggest impediment to Agile really culture change? How do you do that at scale?
03:00 What is getting in the way of culture?
04:16 I can change my attitude and value system, but will the organization support that changed attitude and belief?
04:51 The mindset shift is just the starting point
07:15 How do you get 1,000 people to simultaneously have a mindset shift and then know what to go do
07:42 Is the industry still stuck? How do we get past wanting Agile to being able to do Agile?
08:12 A positive Agile culture has to be reinforced
10:07 The difference between culture and the basic actions you should do
11:29 Can you have the behavior without the culture system shift?
13:29 Can you use the mechanics to reach a desired end state without worrying about becoming Agile?
15:35 Where does Mike see the industry going in 2017?
19:49 Does the organization really need to understand how Agile works or can someone coach the organization into an Agile state?
22:02 How does the organization recognize the fundamentals of what needs to be changed to achieve Organizational Agility?
24:18 Does having data that explains the problem help strengthen the case for change?
25:10 Your organization is deeply flawed.
26:41 How are we going to measure that the problem was indeed solved?

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>MLB Advanced Media has been growing very rapidly over the past few years and even if you aren’t a fan of baseball, you’ve probably been the beneficiary of their work. Michael Daly and Matt Volpe have been managing teams and providing internal Agile coaching at MLB every step of the way.
